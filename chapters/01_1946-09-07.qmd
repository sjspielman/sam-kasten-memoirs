First of all, I would like to make a brief introduction, and I would like to say that when I attempt to describe much of what I have been through in these fifty years I have been playing Yiddish theater in America, and a lot of what I heard and saw in the those fifty years at the Yiddish theater here, I feel it exactly as if I were now for the first time – dressed in "vinegar and honey"^[Yiddish idiom meaning "dressed to kill"; "all dolled up"], released alone on a big stage in a huge theater, with the eyes of thousands and thousands of people turned to me; Everyone is waiting, everyone is looking out for something to hear something from me, but I'm standing in a panic, in a state of confusion and I don't know where to begin...
Well, really, what do I start with and what do I leave for later? Fifty years on stage is no small thing!
Fifty years of acting!
Fifty years of singing!
Fifty years of dancing!
And over half a century, which has already passed and will never return, I knew the greatest and most famous Jewish actors, the pioneers, the builders and founders of Jewish theater in America; I was close friends with most of them and about even one of them I have something to tell, although not everything can be told...
Where do I begin?

And suddenly so many events and moments that I had forgotten for a long time come to mind. I suddenly remember things I have not thought of for a long time. The figures of people who were once very close to me float before my eyes, and suddenly they are here in the real world.
and when their names are mentioned and you talk to them about what performed on the Jewish stage in America and roles they created when they were at the top, you shake your head and realize, that when they were alive, they were not appreciated enough and that if they were alive now, people would know how to appreciate them...

And the more I immerse myself in what is now floating in my memory, the more it turns out that everything is gone, gone...
Away in the distant past, which is gradually being forgotten more and more.
I'm thinking about this now and even for me, the funny comedian on the Jewish stage, it weighs heavily on my heart and I don't know where to begin.


It's a long way back...but still!
When you think about the long road you traveled, and you have in mind not only the others, but also yourself, it seems that everything was just yesterday...
That's why I will start with myself, and as I involve many others as well, and all in all, I believe a piece of history of fifty years of Yiddish theater in America will be reflected in my stories. I am sure that the thousands and thousands Jews people who are interested in the Jewish life of the past and present will find this interesting.

So, I will start with myself, as is usually the case in a memoir. And right from the beginning I want to say, not unlike many other Jews that came to America from Russia and from many other countries, I did not bring my name to America; My name was not Sam Kestin back home, but Shmuel'ik Konstantinovsky. That's the name they gave me. That's what everyone called me, and no one there, God forbid, ever thought about how difficult it was to get such a long name out... 

I don't know what city I was born in. And let no one think that this is some joke on my part, or a prank by a comedian who sometimes plays one one the stage. All my years I tried to find out what city, or what town, I was born in, but all my efforts were in vain and I couldn't find any talk about it, because there were two opinions: One opinion was that I was born in Kiev, in the current capital of Ukraine; It was said that this happened just then when my mother visited Kiev to see a very close relative of ours, who lived there on the Solomenka. More than once I heard my mother and father talk about this. And I was very satisfied that I was born in such a big city as Kiev... To be born in the world, in a big beautiful city, and not some kind of wasteland shtetl nobody has heard of or knows where it is... 

But, as if to spite me, as though it was not _beshert_^[fate/destiny] that I could take pride in this, there was a second opinion about where I was born - not in the big city of Kiev, but in the small village of Zatishiye, which is located between the two cities of Belaya Tserkov^[as it is known in Yiddish. In Ukrainian, "Bila Tserkva"] and Vasilkyv^[Ukrainian, Vasilkov], in Kiev province.

I'm not sure what is true. We have this whole issue with us, the family is so confused, it was impossible to make sense of this. One thing, however, I am sure of, is that I was born
The best thing about it is that I am alive and that for fifty years, I have been acting and singing and dancing on the Jewish stage in America. I also know that now I am already, baruch hashem, 77 years old, and that means that I was born in 1869, when Alexander the 2nd was still sitting on the throne of Russia.

This was exactly eight years after the _panchina_^[Russia abolished serfdom in 1861] was abolished in Russia and we were living in a shtetl I still remember those Ukrainian farmers well, who always told stories about the times during the panchina when the landowners could do with the peasants what they wanted.

In the village of Zatishiye, where we lived for a long time, my _tate_^[ "tateh" - father], Leyb-Sender^["Lion-protector of mankind"], had a farm, and that is why they called him Leyb-Sender the _Possessor_^[the farmer, I believe in Ukrainian?], and my _mame_^["mameh" - mother] was called Feige the _Possessorka_^["-ka" suffix is female in Ukrainian]. When he was home, he was doing business with the big landowner, Graf^[ Graf is count/earl in Russian] Branitsky, who was the owner of the whole village and who also had a large fortune and was loaded with money.

_Tate_ was a constant presence in the court of the landowner, and I still remember how every time, when he had to go to the landowner, he combed his beautiful beard in a very special way with his two fingertips, and when he came back, but he had to tell many stories about the strange nobles’ whims that he could not understand. And all the usual stories ended with the fact that he, my father, gave a thumbs-up and said:

-- _It's a nation/people!_^[ Not a good translation here.]

And by this he meant, what is there say - it's his world, not ours...


He was a very frum Jew, my _tate_. He carefully preserved Judaism with all the details and rules, and he shunned transgressions, just as one shuns fire. He also wanted his children to be frum and pious. There were six of us children at home, two sons and four daughters, and _tate_ was afraid that we would became, God forbid, _goyishe_ from the village^[ They lived close to many Ukrainians]. He introduced that always, summer and winter, we should keep a melamed^[ Torah teacher] in the house for us, who should study with us. Not only with the boys, but also with the girls.

He also introduced that on Shabbat or a Yom Tov we should not be in the village. In the village, he said, a Jew cannot observe Shabbat and Yom Tov. And that's why we all used to go to a Jewish hostel in the city on Shabbat and Yom Tov where kosher was kept so meticulously that even the Rebbe himself would eat there.

After praying, he would always get joy from bringing some poor guests from the shul to the hostel, and they would eat there at his expense. And _mame_ enjoyed it greatly; She was very pleased that _tate_ behaved in such a godly manner. And when she was well-rested, she used to say to him, with a loving smile in her eyes, "Leyb-Sender, if hashem wills your 120 years, you will enter Gan Eden right away...' Sometimes he replied: “Well, what else are we living for?"

And at home, my father always behaved like a true frum person and he did everything he could so that we, the children in the house, would follow his ways. But living in the village had such an effect on us, that it was hard to walk always on the road that our father had led us on. The stillness of the nature around us attracted me like a magnet and when I could, I quietly slipped away from the _melamed_ and went outside and ran away. I crossed the dusty village roads and went to the wide fields that stretched far away, where heaven and earth meet, and I played with the _goyishe_ children and felt free, just like the birds that fly away.

I was a very sly to sneak out quietly, so that the _melamed_ wouldn't see it. I was able to do this so quickly that even before people looked around I was already so far away that they couldn't see me. And I already had my own roads where to run in my own places where to hang out. And I wasn't afraid of anyone, because I was a overprotected child; My parents have always given me a lot, they have loved and pampered me. And I was always sure that they would not punish me. I don't know why I was praised so much. It could be that it was because of that, I was little, a little elf, and who looks very pitiful/small so nobody has the heart to treat me too harshly. But no matter what - I was blessed and I could do what I wanted and I always avoided punishment...


Of all the things in the village, I liked more than anything the crowd of the young Ukrainian farmers and peasants. I really liked to see how they dance to the beat of a harmonica, which can be seen so widely while playing, that it is simply a pleasure to watch. More than once in the village I followed them to the Ukrainian chapel, where they played at a goyishe wedding and I could not take my eyes off the dancers, who danced so much that the ground really shook under their feet. And when I came home afterwards, I danced all day long, those dances which I liked so much. And once, when the father saw this, he gave a me tug on the shoulders shoulder and taking in his hand both tips of his beard, he said: 'Just look, just look at the little Shmuel'ikel of ours dance!... What's so great about you? What are you skipping/frolicking around for?

I was very ashamed then. Why did I jump around so much in the middle of it? But just as quickly _tate_ left the house, he gave me a hug,  and then I just danced again...

> Hop, mai ritshaniki,
> Hop, mai mili.^[ I assume this is a Ukrainian dance?]

It was good for me. I was happy...
