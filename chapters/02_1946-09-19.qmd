By nature, {{< var tate >}} was the sort of person who was always inspired by something. Needless to say, he was a {{< var chasid >}} - a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarov_(Hasidic_dynasty)">{{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasid >}}</a>. When he was able to get away from work in the village, he left for [{{< var Makariv >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makariv) to see the {{< var rebbe >}}^[Leader of a {{< var chasidic >}} dynasty], and he would come back a completely different man. He would tell a story of the {{< var chiddush >}}^[[halakhic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) innovation; new way of doing something in orthodox Judaism] that he saw at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s, and he sang all the {{< var nigunim >}}^[songs/tunes] that he heard there.


In our house, {{< var tate >}} created an atmosphere where you could literally see and feel how his faith in God and in his {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} were connected with everything. When business went well and we didn't have any problems with the landowner, {{< var tate >}} was sure that it was thanks to the blessings and wishes that the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} gave him. The first chance he got, he would go to the {{< var rebbe >}} and give him {{< var pidyon >}}^[A monetary gift to a {{< var chasidic >}} {{< var rebbe >}} to support them and receive blessings] and be joyous together with the other {{< var chasidim >}}.

And on the other hand if, {{< var chalilah >}}, business went poorly and we suffered from the landowner's capriciousness, of course then he had to go to the {{< var rebbe >}}, pour out his bitter heart to him, and beg for him to give his blessing and pray that God will help. When a family member fell ill, before anything else {{< var tate >}} would go to the {{< var rebbe >}} and ask him to grant {{< var refua-shlema >}}^[healing]. Everything was connected to belief in God and in the holy {{< var rebbe >}}, even the {{< var nigunim >}} that we used to sing at home, during a {{< var simcha >}}^[joyous occasion with religious connotation], or anytime at all that you had joy in your heart...

In his enthusiasm for the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}, it wasn't enough for {{< var tate >}} to just to him from time to time. He also brought the {{< var rebbe >}} to our home a few times a year. These visits brought great joy, and the local Jewish farmers from all the surrounding {{< var shtetls >}}^[Plural of {{< var shtetl >}}] came to us in {{< var zat >}} and they shed their village pride. During {{< var seudat-shabbat >}}^[The third meal of Shabbat], people swallowed, enraptured, every word the {{< var rebbe >}} uttered in his {{< var dvar-toireh >}}^[sermon] about the {{< var parsheh >}}^[Torah portion] of the week.

As enthusiastic as {{< var tate >}} was about the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} {{< var tzaddik >}}^[righteous man, generally used when referring to {{< var chasidic >}} rebbes], you can imagine how it went whenver the {{< var rebbe >}} came to visit us in {{< var zat >}}. When {{< var tate >}} heard that the {{< var rebbe >}} had been spotted in his rickshaw at the village gate, he went out to meet him with a song. While singing, he unharnessed the horse from the rickshaw, and taking the reins with both hands, he himself led the great {{< var rebbe >}} to our home. You could see on his face how much pleasure this gave him, and he considered it such a great {{< var mitzvah >}} that he would not give it up for all the treasures in the world.

To this day, I can still picture {{< var tate >}} so clearly pulling the {{< var rebbe >}}'s rickshaw while his face shines with joy. I also remember what the joy in general in our house when {{< var tate >}} came home with the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}; The Jewish farmers of the neighboring villages, all simple healthy and strong Jews, but ardently {{< var chasidic >}} and very pious, were suddenly very different people. It was none other than the {{< var ruakh-hakodesh >}}^[spirit of God] coming over them. Just as if a miracle had happened, all of a sudden their arrogance left them and they entered into such a spiritual nobility never before seen.

They sang with such fervor that it was a pleasure to listen to them, and they danced with such exuberance as if they were floating in the air... Among the {{< var chasidim >}}, I saw for the first time in my life how Jews danced. And I liked it so much that I went and danced with them... I was still a little boy then, and during the dance I tripped on my feet. I was always trying to grab a hold of the tails of someone's [kaftan](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/קפוטה#/media/קובץ:Grand_Rebbes.jpg)as I skipped together with the {{< var chasidim >}} who were so delighted the {{< var rebbe >}} was there. When {{< var tate >}} saw how I danced and caught on to the {{< var chasidic >}} movements and the {{< var nigunim >}}, he really {{< var kvelled >}} over it and pinched me on the cheek, saying "Well done, {{< var shmuelikel >}}. Well done."

The other {{< var chasidim >}} also {{< var kvelled >}} that I, a little boy, small as an elf, joined in the round and so quickly picked up their style of dancing. One of them, a [{{< var gabbai >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbai) of the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}, a redheaded man with a beautiful beard and two long plump hands, said to my father afterwards, "Just look, just look, {{< var Leybs >}}! He is truly something unusual and delightful, the little one! ... {{< var Nu >}}, may God help, that he will be dedicated to the {{< var torah >}}, to the {{< var chuppah >}}, and to {{< var maysim >}} {{< var toivm >}}^[good deeds]... He is growing, isn't he... He is a growing vessel..."

In my love for dancing, I went back and forth between both Jewish and {{< var goyishe >}} dance. It didn't make any difference to me - as long as I was dancing. It was enough for me to just hear some {{< var nigun >}}, and I would immediately start dancing to it. Even just walking around I did in a dancing sort of way. And to this day, I don't understand what I was so joyful for, what put me in such high spirits, that from the start I danced with such gusto...

But there came a time when I stopped dancing and could not be as happy as I was - when {{< var tate >}} suddenly started to complain about his health. "I'm sick, {{< var Feige >}}," he would often say to {{< var mame >}}. "I'm very sick... and somehow my heart tells me that it's not good. Really not good..." He went to the {{< var rebbe >}} several times who wished him a {{< var refua-shlema >}}, but it didn't help. Still, {{< var tate >}} complained, "I am sick, {{< var Feige >}}. Very sick."

No matter how small I was, I still felt and understood that his complaints about his poor health meant a difficult time was falling upon us, and it made me melancholy. When I would forget about it, as children do, I would start to sing some kind of {{< var nigun >}}, sometimes a Yiddish one and sometimes a {{< var goyishe >}} one, and I'd begin to dance along. But {{< var mame >}} would scold me, "Shame on you, {{< var shmuelikel >}}. You should be ashamed of yourself! {{< var Tate >}} is sick and you are acting joyfully..."

Our whole house became a different place when {{< var tate >}} fell ill. And there was nothing we could do for his illness, because there was no doctor in the village, no medical practitioner, and not even a pharmacy. No matter how much we begged {{< var tate >}} to see a doctor in {{< var vasil >}}, or in {{< var bt >}}, he would not go. We could not prevail upon him at all, and he had the same answer to everything: "What can a doctor help me with? How long I am destined to live in the world, to be alive... The doctor will not give me more years to live; A man is in God's hands..."

With great difficulty, we finally managed to convince him to let us bring a doctor from {{< var vasilch >}}, an absent-minded Jew who had some kind of panacea for all diseases in the world. The doctor from {{< var vasilch >}} gave {{< var tate >}} a tincture, and told him that if things didn't get better to call him again...

At that time, my oldest sister {{< var Batsheva >}} became a bride, and it is worth telling the story of how the {{< var shidduch >}}^[match, as in matchmaking] was made, because it's very typical of the Jewish life in those days.

Among the {{< var chasidim >}} that my {{< var tate >}} often met at the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}'s court, there was a man named {{< var radetsky-full >}}. {{< var radetsky >}}, a Jewish landowner, lived in the town of {{< var rybinka >}}^[now known as ["Hrebinka"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrebinka)], which is not far from {{< var vasilch >}}, and just like my father, he was also an ardent {{< var chasid >}}, a zealot, and he often went to the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}'s. As it usually happens, at the rejoicings at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s court, people often drank {{< var lchaim >}}^[Cheers; here it implies everyone making toasts and drinking many drinks] and wished for salvation for the Jews. And once, when my father was drinking {{< var lchaim >}} with {{< var radetsky-full >}}, they talked for a while about this and that, whatever came to mind. Each time, someone else poured a glass of whiskey and, as usual, an "order" started:

-- {{< var Lchaim >}}! May God will it so!

-- {{< var Lchaim >}} {{< var toivm-u-sholem >}}! God bless you, and so it will be!

So, little by little, they drank another glass and another glass, and showered each other with blessings and wishes. During their conversation, my {{< var tate >}} told {{< var pinya >}} that his wife was pregnant and he hoped that, {{< var baruch-hashem >}}, the birth passes peacefully. And when {{< var pinya >}} heard this, he got excited and told {{< var tate >}} that his wife was also preparing to give birth. Soon, in the blink of an eye, it was already agreed between the two {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasidim >}} that if one's wife gave birth to a boy and the other's wife to a girl, they would make a {{< var shidduch >}}.

They shook hands and made a {{< var tekkaf >}}^[formal Jewish agreement]. The deal was done.

A short time after that, my mother gave birth to a girl named {{< var Batsheva >}}. {{< var radetsky-full >}}'s wife also gave birth to a boy, and he was named Aron^[According to their tombstones, they were born in 1859: [Aron's tombstone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233934941/aaron-rodesky) and [{{< var Batsheva >}}'s tombstone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233934924/bashava-rodesky), making them about 10 years older than {{< var sam >}}]. And so, as agreed in the {{< var tekkaf >}}, this {{< var shidduch >}} was {{< var beshert >}} and this marriage was {{< var m-hashamayim >}}^[from heaven (Hebrew/religious term); so, this is a "match made in heaven"].

And so, my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}, the oldest of all the children in our family, was already a bride the moment she was born. And that's how she was really treated even when she was still a very little girl, already "{{< var Batsheva >}}, the bride." {{< var Tate >}} loved {{< var Batsheva >}} very much and showed her a lot of tenderness, not only when she was still little but when also as she grew. All the while, he was looking forward to the time when she would go to the {{< var chuppah >}}^[the "chuppah" is the Jewish canopy under which one weds].

They had decided to have {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding on the {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}}^[Shavuot], but {{< var tate >}}'s health was already so poor that it was no wonder that he couldn't think about anything other than whether he would live to see his first daughter's wedding... You could tell because he suddenly started working to move the date up from the {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}} to two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}^[Passover; Two weeks before Passover is nine weeks before Shavuot, this would move the wedding 10-11 weeks up.]...

"I want to be at my oldest daughter's wedding," he said. "I want to take her to the {{< var chuppah >}}..." Apparently, he knew in his heart that he would not live for long. He felt it. Everyone in the family felt it. So we decided not to move my sister's wedding up to two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}, as my father wished...

My parents began to prepare for the great {{< var simcha >}} when, with God's help, they would lead to the couple who were blessed with a {{< var tekkaf >}} before they were born to the {{< var chuppah >}}. And while preparing for the wedding, we were also preparing for a funeral...

You had to prepare for it, even when you didn't want to, because {{< var tate >}} was already so sick that it was clear he would not live much longer. He himself knew this more than anyone else. And that's why {{< var tate >}} often repeated the only thing that made sense to him at the time, "I want to at my oldest daughter's wedding... I want to lead {{< var Batsheva >}} to the {{< var chuppah >}} and I beg God, give me strength so that I may see before my death that my family honors the {{< var tekkaf >}}..."

He counted the days that remained until two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}. He looked forward to the very hour... 

I also counted the days left until the wedding. But I did not understand the silent tragedy that was taking place there. I was still too young to understand it all. I just wanted dance at the first wedding in our family...
