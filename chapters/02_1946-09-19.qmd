By nature, {{< var tate >}} was one of those types of people who would always be inspired by something. Needless to say, he was a {{< var chasid >}} - a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarov_(Hasidic_dynasty)">{{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasid >}}</a>. When he was able to tear himself away from his livelihood in the village, he left for {{< var Makariv >}} to see the {{< var rebbe >}}^[Rabbi, but specifically one who leads a {{< var chasidic >}} dynasty], and when he came back from there he was completely different and he would tell one story of the {{< var chiddush >}}^[[halakhic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) innovation; new way of doing something in orthodox Judaism] that he saw at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s, and he sang all the {{< var nigunim >}}^[songs/tunes, "lai-dai-dai" etc.] that he heard there.


In general, at our house, in the small village of {{< var zat >}}, there was such atmosphere that you could literally see and feel how {{< var tate >}}'s faith in God and in his {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} were connected with everything - When the business went well and we didn't have any problems with the landowner, {{< var tate >}} was sure that it was thanks to the blessings and wishes that the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} gave him, and so, he should go the first chance he has to the {{< var rebbe >}} and give him the fine fruit and be joyous together with the other {{< var chasidim >}}.

And on the other hand if, God forbid, business went poorly and people had to endure the landowner's caprices, they really needed to go to the rabbi, pour out their bitter heart to him and beg for him to give his blessing and pray that God will help.

Also, when something struck the household and a family member became ill, {{< var tate >}}, before anything else, went to the {{< var rebbe >}} and asked him to grant him {{< var refua-shlema >}}^[healing]. Believing in God and in them, holy _rebbes_, was connected. Even with the {{< var nigunim >}} that we used to sing at home, during a {{< var simcha >}}^[joyous occasion with religious connotation], or just when you had joy in your heart...

In his enthusiasm for the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}, it wasn't enough for {{< var tate >}} that he drove to him from time to time; He also brought the {{< var rebbe >}} to our home a few times a year, and usually there was a great joy and the local Jewish farmers from all the surrounding shtetls came to us in {{< var zat >}}, weekly and during the {{< var seudat-shabbat >}}^[[The three meals of Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_meals)], people swallowed with admiration every word that the {{< var rebbe >}} uttered from his mouth during the {{< var dvar-toireh >}}^[sermon] about the {{< var parsheh >}}^[Torah portion] of the week.

As far as my father could go in his enthusiasm for the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} {{< var tzadik >}}^[righteous man], you can imagine what happened when the {{< var rebbe >}} came to us in {{< var zat >}} - when {{< var tate >}} heard that the {{< var rebbe >}} had been spotted in his rickshaw at the gate of the village, he went out to meet him with a song, and while singing, he unharnessed the horse from the rickshaw and accepting the reins with both hands, he himself led the great {{< var rebbe >}} in the rickshaw our home. You could see on his face that this gave him so much pleasure, and he considered it such a great {{< var mitzvah >}} that he would not give it up for all the treasures in the world.


To this day, I still have that picture in front of my eyes and I see {{< var tate >}} so clearly, as he is pulling the {{< var rebbe >}}'s rickshaw and his face shines with joy. I also remember what kind of joy there was in general at our house every time {{< var tate >}} brought down the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}; The Jewish farmers of the neighboring villages, all simple healthy and strong Jews, but ardently chasidic and very pious, were suddenly very different people; It was none other than the {{< var ruakh-hakodesh >}} ^[holy power] that started floating them. Just as if a miracle had happened, all of a sudden the rustic arrogance left them and they entered into such a spiritual nobility that was never seen before.

And they sang with such fervor that it was a pleasure to listen to them, and they danced with such exuberance as if they were carrying themselves in the air... Among them, among the {{< var chasidim >}}, for the first time in my life I saw how Jews danced. And I liked it so much that I went and danced with them... I was still a little boy then, and during the dance I fell on my feet. I was always trying to grab a hold of the tails of someone's {{< var kapote >}}^[[Long black coat](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/קפוטה#/media/קובץ:Grand_Rebbes.jpg) that {{< var chasidic >}} men wear], and I hopped/skipped together with the {{< var chasidim >}} who were so delighted by the presence of the {{< var rebbe >}}.

And when my {{< var tate >}} saw that I danced, and in dancing all the {{< var chasidic >}} movements movements and I was catching onto the {{< var nigun >}}, he really {{< var kvelled >}} over it and he gave me a pinch on the cheek:

-- Well done, {{< var shmuelikel >}} - he said - Well done.

The other {{< var chasidim >}} also {{< var kvelled >}} over the fact that I, a little boy, who was as big as an elf, joined in the round and I so quickly picked up their way of dancing. And one of them, a [{{< var gabbai >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbai) of the Makarover {{< var rebbe >}}, a man with a beautiful beard, a redhead, and with two long hands, very plump, said to my father afterwards:

–– Just look, just look, {{< var Leybs >}}! He is indeed something unusual and delightful, the little one! ... {{< var Nu >}}, may God help, that he will be dedicated to the {{< var torah >}}, to the {{< var chuppah >}}, and to {{< var maysim >}} {{< var toivm >}}^[good deeds]... He is growing, isn't he... He is a growing vessel..."

In my love of dancing, I planted myself between Jewish and {{< var goyishe >}} dance. It didn't matter to me, any sort of dance. It was enough for me to hear some {{< var nigun >}}, I would immediately start dancing to it. Even just around walking, I did in a dancing sort of way. And to this day, I don't understand what I was so joyful for, what put me in such high spirits, that from the start I danced with such gusto...

But there came a time when I stopped dancing and could not be as happy as usual. This was when {{< var tate >}} suddenly started to complain about his health.


-- I'm sick, {{< var Feige >}} - he often said to {{< var mame >}} - I'm very sick... and somehow my heart tells me that it's not good. Really not good..."

He then went to the {{< var rebbe >}} several times, and the {{< var rebbe >}} wished him a {{< var refua-shlema >}}, but it didn't help. He still complained:

-- I am sick, {{< var Feige >}}. Very sick.

No matter how small I was, I still felt and understood that because he complains so often about his poor health, a very difficult time is falling on us, and it made me melancholy and depressed. And when I would forget about it, as is usually the way with a child, and I would start to sing some kind of {{< var nigun >}}_dl_, sometimes a Yiddish one and sometimes a {{< var goyishe >}} one, and while singing, I began to dance along, {{< var mame >}} scolded me:

-- Shame on you, {{< var shmuelikel >}}. You should be ashamed of yourself; {{< var Tate >}} is sick and you are acting joyfully...

Our whole house became a different place when {{< var tate >}} fell ill. And nothing could be done about the illness, because in the village there was no doctor, no medical practitioner, and not even a pharmacy. No matter how much they begged {{< var tate >}} to bring him a doctor from {{< var vasil >}}, or from {{< var bt >}}, he did not want to. We could not prevail upon him at all, and he the same answer to everything: "What can a doctor help me with? How long I am destined to live in the world, to be alive... The doctor will not give me more years to live; A man is in God's hands..."

With great difficulty, we managed to convince him to let us bring a doctor from {{< var vasilch >}}, some sort of "absent-minded" Jew, who had some kind of panacea for all diseases in the world^[As in, a single way to cure any disease]. And he, the doctor from {{< var vasilch >}}, gave the father some sort of drug, and told him that if things didn't get better to call him again...

At that time, my oldest sister, {{< var Batsheva >}}, became a bridge, and it is worth telling the story of how this {{< var shiduch >}}^[match, as in matchmaking] was made, because all around it is very characteristic of the Jewish life of that time:

Among the {{< var chasidim >}} that my {{< var tate >}} often met at the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}'s court, there was one {{< var radetsky-full >}}. {{< var radetsky >}}, a Jewish landowner, lived in the town of {{< var rybinka >}}^[now known as ["Hrebinka"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrebinka)], which is not far from {{< var vasilch >}}, and just like my father, he was also an ardent chasid, a zealot, and he often went to the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}'s. As it usually happens, at the rejoicings at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s court, people often drank {{< var lchaim >}}^[Cheers; "to life"] and wished for salvation for the Jews. And once, when my father was drinking {{< var lchaim >}} with {{< var radetsky-full >}} from the town of {{< var rybinka >}}, for a while they were already talking about this and that, whatever just came to the tongue; Each time, someone else poured a cup of whiskey and, as usual, an "order" started:

-- {{< var Lchaim >}}! May God will it so!

-- {{< var Lchaim >}} {{< var toivm-u-sholem >}}! God bless you, and so it will be!

So, little by little, they drank another glass and another glass, and showered each other with blessings and wishes, and in the conversation that took place between them, my father told {{< var pinya >}} that his wife is pregnant and he hopes that, {{< var baruch-hashem >}}^["[Blessed be G-d](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5694247/jewish/What-Does-Baruch-Hashem-Mean.htm)"], the birth will pass peacefully. And when {{< var pinya >}} heard this, he got excited and told {{< var tate >}} that his wife was also preparing to give birth. Soon, in the blink of an eye, it was already agreed between the two {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasidim >}} that if the wife of one gave birth to an boy and the wife of the other gave birth to a girl, there should be a match.

And they shook hands, made a {{< var tekkaf >}}^[formal Jewish agreement]. And so it remained. A short time after that, my mother gave birth to a girl and she was named {{< var Batsheva >}}. {{< var radetsky-full >}}'s wife also gave birth to a boy, and he was named Aron^[According to their tombstones, they were born in 1859: [Aron's tombstone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233934941/aaron-rodesky) and [{{< var Batsheva >}}'s tombstone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233934924/bashava-rodesky), making them about 10 years older than Sam]. And so, as agreed in the {{< var tekkaf >}}, because the wife of one {{< var chasid >}} gave birth to a girl and the other gave birth to a boy, it was said that it is {{< var beshert >}} and this is a marriage {{< var m-hashamayim >}} ^[from heaven (Hebrew/religious term)].

And so, my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}, the oldest of all the children in our family, was already a bride immediately after she was born. And that's how she was really treated even when she was still a very little girl: "{{< var Batsheva >}}, the bride." {{< var Tate >}} loved {{< var Batsheva >}} very much and he showed her a lot of tenderness, not only when she was still a little girl, but when also when she was grown, and he was looking forward to the time when they will lead her to the {{< var chuppah >}}.

And just in that year, when it was decided to have {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding on the {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}}^[Shavuot], {{< var tate >}}'s health was already so poor that it was no wonder that he couldn't think about anything other than whether or not he would live to be with his first daughter's wedding... You could tell from how he suddenly started working to move the marriage from {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}} to instead be two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}^[Passover]...

-- I want to be at the wedding of my eldest daughter. - he said - I want to take her to the {{< var chuppah >}}...

At that time, apparently, his knew in his heart that that he would not live for long. He felt it. Everyone in the family felt it. And therefore we decided not to wait for my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding until until {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}}, but rather two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}, as my father wishes...

And they began to prepare for the great {{< var simcha >}}, when, with God's voice, they will lead to the couple, who were blessed with a {{< var tekkaf >}} before they were born, to the {{< var chuppah >}}. And while preparing for the wedding, people also prepared for a funeral...

You had to think about it, even when you didn't want to, because {{< var tate >}} was already so sick and he was feeling so bad that you knew that he would not live much longer. He himself knew this more than anyone else. And that's why {{< var tate >}} often repeated the only thing that made sense to him at the time: "I want to be with my eldest daughter at the wedding... I want to lead {{< var Batsheva >}} to the {{< var chuppah >}} and I beg God, may he give me strength so that I may see before my death that my family honors the {{< var tekkaf >}}..."

And he counted the days that remained until two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}. And he looked forward to the good hour...I also counted the days left until the wedding. But I did not understand the silent tragedy that was taking place there. I was still too young to understand this. I just wanted dance at the first wedding in our family...
