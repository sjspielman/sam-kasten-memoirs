{{< var tate >}} did everything he could so no one would focus on how gravely ill he was. A few times a day, he would get out of bed and wander around the house, with a cane, and touch and look at everything we had bought for {{< var Batsheva >}} and prepared for the wedding. When the inlaws arrived, he also thought that we shouldn't forget about our poorer relatives who lived in the nearby {{< var shtetls >}} around the area. Every time he remembered one poor relative or another, he would say, "For God's sake, don't forget them too!" He would also say that there should be as many poor people as possible at the wedding feast.

"Don't spare a dime, {{< var Feige >}}," he would said to {{< var mame >}}, who, even more than he did, really made an effort to hide the heavy thoughts she was carrying because of his illness. "Don't spare a dime!... It costs so much already, we can pay a little more... God is our father and he will not abandon us..."

{{< var Mame >}} did everything that {{< var tate >}} told her. But once it became clear to her that he was walking around the house with his cane too much, she beseeched him, "Follow me, {{< var Leybs >}}, and lie down. You are already tired and you need to rest. And believe me," she continued leading him to his secluded alcove to rest, "believe me that at our daughter {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding, {{< var mirtzeshem >}}^[Yiddish vernacular for the Hebrew אם ירצה השם, "If it is God's will"], we won't want for a single thing. It will be good for God and man alike..."

And so it was.

At the wedding, which took place two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}, in the little village of {{< var zat >}} between {{< var vasil >}} and {{< var bt >}}, so much family came that even at a fair you never saw so many people. There wasn't a single Jewish landowner in all the nearby {{< var shtetls >}} and towns who didn't come to the wedding. Among the landowners, all Jews with a broad hand and a lot of power and strength, there were also {{< var chasidim >}} of the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}. My {{< var tate >}} wouldn't invite any other {{< var chasidim >}}^[as in, no other kinds of {{< var chasidim >}} - only {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasidim >}}]. He would certainly not have them at the doorstep of his house. And the Jewish landowners did not come alone, but with their wives and children, and they drove to the village in horse-drawn carriages. Just as they felt at home among the Jews, so too they felt at home among the {{< var goyim >}}, and they spoke the {{< var goyishe >}} language Ukrainian just as freely and easily as they spoke Yiddish.

All the landowners and family the {{< var shtetls >}} from who came to the wedding made way for Abba the klezmer musician with his band of musicians, who were brought down from {{< var bt >}}. Abba the klezmer musician, was a smart, cunning Jew, who even then, even in those times, wore a pressed shirt and a refined, short little kaftan that fell right to his waist. He wasn't born yesterday, and he knew how to perform for high-ranking courtiers, for whom a "_kerbel is a mumzer_"^[idiom: "a ruble is a bastard," meaning money was no object].

The greatest wears brought for my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding were from the rich farmer {{< var eliezer-shmuel >}}, who had a reputation for being a very wealthy, powerful man with a generous hand. Abba and his muscians performed for him some kind of _"vivetsh"_ and some kind of _"dobrivetsh"_ , over which {{< var eliezer-shmuel >}} himself was truly beside himself with joy and said that he had never heard anything like it before...

The {{< var simcha >}} was great. The wedding turned the whole village of {{< var zat >}} upside-down. Our goyishe neighbors, simple farmers and peasants, felt just like family and came to the wedding. They brought gifts and danced and offered their best wishes to the groom and the bride, they may be blessed with good fortune and never know bad times... In those days, Jews and {{< var goyim >}} still lived together in peacefully in the villages... The {{< var goyim >}} began to show hatred towards the Jews only later, when they were persuaded that the alone Jews were to blame for all the troubles that befell them...

But no matter how great the {{< var simcha >}} at the wedding was with Jews and {{< var goyim >}} celebrating together in the village, the joy was still overshadowed. And how could it not be, because the whole time {{< var tate >}} was so ill and so weak. Everytime he sat at the table, cane in hand, to watch everyone dancing and rejoicing, he would soon turn his head away, his face would grow pale, and he'd have to be taken back home to rest in bed for a little while.

{{< var Mame >}} usually was the one to take him home. She was always the first to notice how pale his face became when he sat down. He didn't resist when she led him back to rest. Leaning on his cane with a strange smile on his sallow face, he walked with a sense of submission. He no longer had even a trace of strength, of the {{< var possessor >}}'s authority and confidence he had before he got sick. 

Walking like this with {{< var mame >}}, he comforted and reassured her, "It's not over, {{< var Feige >}}, it's not over... Soon I will come back out to celebrate again... It's not over! Let the music play on! Let us dance! Let us be happy!"

As far as he could, he gathered all his strength, and with {{< var mame >}} he led his daughter to the {{< var chuppah >}} - his very first daughter, whom he had married off before she was even born...

His new kaftan hung loosely on him because he was so emaciated and weak. But his face still shone. You could see how joyous and lucky he felt to lead his first child to the {{< var chuppah >}}. After the ceremony when the dancing began, I watched as he {{< var kvelled >}} and clapped his hands, and I was suddenly overcome with such a strong desire to make him happy that I didn't know what to do. I ran to him, grabbed both his hands, and started kissing them. Tears were falling from my eyes. Tears of joy. Soon I entered the round^[As in, dancing in the round] and danced with such joy that my sadness evaporated away, and {{< var tate >}} was full of {{< var naches >}}^[joy/pride].

"Dance, {{< var shmuelik >}}!", he encouraged me each time I ran up to him, full of joy, and kissed his hands again. "Dance {{< var shmuelik >}}! At a wedding one should dance! Wt a wedding one should be happy!..."

And four weeks after the wedding he died.

After {{< var tate >}}'s death, {{< var mame >}} took on the the heavy burden of providing for us. She began running the farm herself, and people started calling her "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}." But as she began immersing herself in the business and learning what she hadn't known she, she soon realized that {{< var tate >}} was not at all as well-off as he came across and he had spent much more than they had... 

For two years, {{< var mame >}} struggled with the farm, and it was very difficult for her to manage. Without {{< var Tate >}}'s authority, without his confident air, their {{< var possessieh >}} couldn't go on as it had before. Nothing worked like it did when {{< var tate >}} did it. We couldn't afford all the things we could when he was still alive. Everything was completely different from what it was...

Even a permanent {{< var melamed >}} for the children could not be kept. And I confess, at the time that didn't bother me so much because I never had a great desire to learn. But now, I regret it very much...

But life went on. When {{< var mame >}} was exhausted from the miserable {{< var possessieh >}} in {{< var zat >}}, she married off my older brother, {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}^[later, he became Isaac Casten in America], who was nicknamed "{{< var katik >}}"^[kitten, in Russian] in the family - he was quiet like a little kitten who's always playing in the corner. {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}} was married to the daughter^[her name was Chuna, later changed to Anna in America] of a certain {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}}^[This is probably incorrect. According to Anna Casten's [gravestone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/152164678/isaac-casten#view-photo=240653611), his name was actually Isaiah-Leyb, not Shmuel.], a Jewish merchant, who lived in {{< var bt >}} and conducted business with other cities as well.

My brother {{< var katik >}}'s wedding was the first time I saw and heard the [{{< var badchen >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badchen) {{< var shakhnes-full >}}, who in those days had made a name for himself in Jewish cities and {{< var shtetls >}} in the {{< var kyiv >}} and Podolier Governorates. He was really an artist in his profession, and he acted like he was building a whole whole dynasty^[This phrasing draws a parallel with [{{< var chasidic >}} dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hasidic_dynasties_and_groups)]. Everyone knew that he doesn't perform at weddings all by himself, but along with his son-in-law who helped with the performance to earn his room and board^[More specifically, this is in support of his קעסט]. 

Whenever the {{< var badchen >}} {{< var shakhnes-full >}} performed the {{< var kalebes >}}^[Wedding song for the bride], the women would always shed tears, and this was no exception. After the {{< var kalebes >}}, he performed a scene that his son-in-law helped with. I still remember the scene they performed during my brother's wedding after they performed the {{< var kalebes >}} which made all the women cry.

Then, {{< var berele >}} himself, with his pointed beard, struck such a pose as if to say you could rely on him and you'd soon see something worth every penny. As he was standing like that, his son-in-law came in disguised as a beggar and began singing a very sad {{< var nigun >}}^[singular {{< var nigunim >}}]:

> I walk the streets
>
> One by one.
>
> I beg for alms,
>
> But no one will look my way.

He sang it one time, and then a second time. And then he implored, "Spare a coin!"

Then {{< var shakhnes-full >}} the {{< var badchen >}} lashed out in anger at the poor beggar, and they began a dialogue:

-- {{< var berele >}}: Hey, you cheapskate, why did you come here just to make the wedding guests sad? This is a wedding where everyone is meant to be happy!

-- Beggar: But how can I be happy, when I am a poor Jew begging for money?

-- {{< var berele >}}: You must be happy!

-- Beggar: I must?

-- {{< var berele >}}: Yes, you must!

-- Beggar: {{< var Nu >}}, if I must, you have to show me how. Come on, how could a poor Jew like me be happy!

-- {{< var berele >}}: I'll show you! Of course, I will show you!

Then, they sang to each other:

> Make merry, pauper,
>
> Enjoy yourself, poor man;
>
> He who has nothing,
>
> really has it all.


I really enjoyed it. I gazed open-mouth at the whole performance in awe, and I can say that this was the first time in my life that I had ever seen theater. Yiddish theater. Even to this day, I still think about the {{< var badchan >}} {{< var shakhnes-full >}}, the first Yiddish actor I ever saw in my life...
