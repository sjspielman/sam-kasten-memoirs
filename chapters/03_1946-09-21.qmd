{{< var tate >}} did everything he could so no one would focus on how gravely ill he was. A few times a day, he would get out of bed and wander around the house, with a cane, and touch and look at everything we had bought for {{< var Batsheva >}} and prepared for the wedding. When the inlaws arrived, he also thought that we shouldn't forget about our poorer relatives who lived in the nearby {{< var shtetl >}}_s_ around the area. Every time he remembered one poor relative or another, he would say, "For God's sake, don't forget them too!" He would also say that there should be as many poor people as possible at the wedding feast.

"Don't spare a dime, {{< var Feige >}}," he would said to {{< var mame >}}, who, even more than he did, really made an effort to hide the heavy thoughts she was carrying because of his illness. "Don't spare a dime!... It costs so much already, we can pay a little more... God is our father and he will not abandon us..."

{{< var Mame >}} did everything that {{< var tate >}} told her. But once it became clear to her that he was walking around the house with his cane too much, she beseeched him, "Follow me, {{< var Leybs >}}, and lie down. You are already tired and you need to rest. And believe me," she continued leading him to his secluded alcove to rest, "believe me that at our daughter {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding, {{< var mirtzeshem >}}^[Yiddish vernacular for the Hebrew אם ירצה השם, "If it is God's will"], we won't want for a single thing. It will be good for God and man alike..."

And so it was.

At the wedding, which took place two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}, in the little village of {{< var zat >}} between {{< var vasil >}} and {{< var bt >}}, so much family came that even at a fair you never saw so many people. There wasn't a single Jewish landowner in all the nearby {{< var shtetl >}}_s_ and towns who didn't come to the wedding. Among them the landowners, all Jews with vast orchards and a lot of power and strength, there were also {{< var chasidim >}} of the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}. My {{< var Tate >}} wouldn't invite any other {{< var chasidim >}}^[as in, no other kinds of {{< var chasidim >}} - only {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasidim >}}]. He would certainly not have them at the doorstep of his house. And the Jewish landowners did not come alone, but with their wives and children, and they drove to the village in horse-drawn carriages. Just as they felt at home among the Jews, so too they felt at home among the {{< var goyim >}}, and they spoke the {{< var goyishe >}} language Ukrainian just as freely and easily as they spoke Yiddish.

All the landowners and family the {{< var shtetl >}}_s_ from who came to the wedding made way for Abba the klezmer musician with his band of musicians, who were brought down from {{< var bt >}}. Abba the klezmer musician, was a smart, cunning Jew, who even then, even in those times, wore a pressed shirt and a refined, short little kaftan that fell right to his waist. He wasn't born yesterday, and he knew how to perform for high-ranking courtiers, for whom a "_kerbel is a mumzer_"^[idiom: "a ruble is a bastard," meaning money was no object].

The greatest wears brought for my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding were from the rich farmer {{< var eliezer-shmuel >}}, who had a reputation for being a very wealthy, powerful man with a generous hand. Abba and his muscians performed for him some kind of _"vivetsh"_ and some kind of _"dobrivetsh"_ , over which {{< var eliezer-shmuel >}} himself was truly beside himself with joy and said that he had never heard anything like it before...

The {{< var simcha >}} was great. The wedding turned the whole village of {{< var zat >}} upside-down. Our goyishe neighbors, simple farmers and peasants, felt just like family and came to the wedding. They brought gifts and danced and offered their best wishes to the groom and the bride, they may be blessed with good fortune and never know bad times... In those days, Jews and {{< var goyim >}} still lived together in peacefully in the villages... The {{< var goyim >}} began to show hatred towards the Jews only later, when they were persuaded that the alone Jews were to blame for all the troubles that befell them...

But no matter how great the {{< var simcha >}} at the wedding was with Jews and {{< var goyim >}} celebrating together in the village, the joy was still overshadowed. And how could it not be, because the whole time {{< var tate >}} was so ill and so weak. Everytime he sat at the table, cane in hand, to watch everyone dancing and rejoicing, he would soon turn his head away, his face would grow pale, and he'd have to be taken back home to rest in bed for a little while.

{{< var Mame >}} usually was the one to take him home. She was always the first to notice how pale his face became when he sat down. He didn't resist when she led him back to rest. Leaning on his cane with a strange smile on his sallow face, he walked with a sense of submission. He no longer had even a trace of strength, of the {{< var possessor >}}'s authority and confidence he had before he got sick. 

Walking like this with {{< var mame >}}, he comforted and reassured her, "It's not over, {{< var Feige >}}, it's not over... Soon I will come back out to celebrate again... It's not over! Let the music play on! Let us dance! Let us be happy!"

As far as he could, he gathered all his strength, and with {{< var mame >}} he led his daughter to the {{< var chuppah >}} - his very first daughter, whom he had married off before she was even born...

His new kaftan hung loosely on him because he was so emaciated and weak. But his face still shone. You could see how joyous and lucky he felt to lead his first child to the {{< var chuppah >}}. After the ceremony when the dancing began, I watched as he {{< var kvelled >}} and clapped his hands, and I was suddenly overcome with such a strong desire to make him happy that I didn't know what to do. I ran to him, grabbed both his hands, and started kissing them. Tears were falling from my eyes. Tears of joy. Soon I entered the round^[As in, dancing in the round] and danced with such joy that my sadness evaporated away, and {{< var tate >}} was full of {{< var naches >}}^[joy/pride].

"Dance, {{< var shmuelik >}}!", he encouraged me each time I ran up to him, full of joy, and kissed his hands again. "Dance {{< var shmuelik >}}! At a wedding one should dance! Wt a wedding one should be happy!..."

And four weeks after the wedding he died.

After {{< var tate >}}'s death, {{< var mame >}} got involved in the heavy burden of making a living. She started to lead the farm by herself, and people started calling her "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}." But soon she began to realize that {{< var tate >}} was not at all as capable as he thought and that he had spent much more and lived much larger than he could afford... For two years, {{< var mame >}} struggled with the farm, and it was difficult for her to get out. {{< var Tate >}}'s fields, his broad orchards, the land they owned in the village could not go as it went before. It was no longer possible to afford what we could when {{< var tate >}} was still alive. It was already something completely different from what it was...

Even a permanent {{< var melamed >}} for the children could not be kept. And at the time that this did not bother me, because to date I have never shown any great desire, and now it often bothers me very much...

But life went on there, and during the times when {{< var mame >}} was tormented by the poverty-inducing property, she married off my older brother, {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}^[later, he became Isaac Casten in America], who was nicknamed {{< var katik >}}^[kitten] in the family - he was quiet like a little kitten who plays only in a corner. {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}} was married to the daughter^[her name was Chuna, later changed to Anna in America] of a certain {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}}^[It is worth noting that {{< var sam >}} may be misremembering his name. According to [Anna's gravestone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/152164678/isaac-casten#view-photo=240653611), her father's name was Isaiah-Leyb, not Shmuel.], a Jewish merchant, who lived in {{< var bt >}} and conducted business with other cities as well.

And at that wedding of my brother {{< var katik >}}, I saw and heard for the first time the [{{< var badchen >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badchen) {{< var shakhnes-full >}}, who at that time had a reputation in many Jewish cities and towns of {{< var kyiv >}} Governorate and also in the Podolier province. He really became an artist in his profession, {{< var shakhnes-full >}}, and he behaved as if he wanted to make a whole dynasty out of it.


People already knew that he doesn't perform at weddings by himself, but was accompanied by his son-in-law who helped with the performance to earn room and board. The {{< var badchen >}} was {{< var shakhnes-full >}} alone, and he performed in such a way that the women would shed tears. And after {{< var kalebes >}}^["Serenading of the bride," a popular Jewish wedding song. [Listen here](https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/AHMP2C6SE53XOV8O/ABJC2CTJMIPMKT8X).], he performed a scene that his son-in-law helped with. And I still remember the scene that he, {{< var shakhnes-full >}}, played with his son-in-law at my older brother's wedding after the {{< var kalebes >}}, which made all the women weep.

{{< var berele >}} himself then stood with his pointed beard and struck such a pose, as if to say you could rely on him and be sure that soon you will see something that is worth all the money. And as he was standing like that, his son-in-law showed up disguised as a beggar, and soon he started singing a very sad {{< var nigun >}}^[singular {{< var nigunim >}}]:

> I walk around in the street
>
> One by one,
>
> I ask people for money/alms,
>
> But they don't want to look at me.

He sang it one time, and then a second time. And immediately afterwards, he begged - "Give me alms!"

And then {{< var shakhnes-full >}} the {{< var badchen >}} released such an anger on the poor beggar, and they began a dialogue:

-- {{< var berele >}}: Hey, you pauper, why did you come here just to make the wedding guests sad? This is a wedding where everyone should be happy!

-- Beggar: But how can I be happy, when I am a poor Jew begging for money?

-- {{< var berele >}}: You must be happy!

-- Beggar: I must?

-- {{< var berele >}}: Yes, you must!

-- Beggar: {{< var Nu >}}, if I must, you have to show me how. Come on, let's see how a poor Jew like me could be happy!

-- {{< var berele >}}: I will show you! Indeed, I will show you!

This is how the dialogue went between the {{< var badchen >}} and his son-in-law who was pretending to be a beggar. And when they were done with their "lines," both sang to each other:

> Make merry, pauper,
>
> enjoy yourself, poor man;
>
> He who has nothing,
>
> really has it all.


We really liked watching them. I really enjoyed it in particular, and I can say that this was the first time in my life that I had ever seen theater. Yiddish theater. And to this day, I still think about {{< var shakhnes-full >}}' performance, as the first Yiddish actor I ever saw in my life...
