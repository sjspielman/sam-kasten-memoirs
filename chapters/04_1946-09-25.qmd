{{< var Tate >}}'s death shook our entire family so much that things could never be as they were. No matter how hard {{< var mame >}} worked so that we would not be in need or have to ask for help, she could not make it happen. It never happened. And then the name "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}" began to sound like a joke, because a {{< var possessor >}} is a generally a professional who has means to live well.

When {{< var mame >}} lost all interest in running the property as {{< var tate >}} had, she left the village and settled in the town of {{< var rybinka >}}, where my sister {{< var Batsheva >}} lived with her husband. And there, in {{< var rybinka >}}, we opened what is called a "sustenance-house,"^[I will use the term "general store" for this moving forward.] where they sell everything that you can think of - even a little drink too.
{{< var Mame >}} worked very hard in the "general store," and she was really a great {{< var eshet-chayal >}}^["woman of valor"] and knew how to get along with people. Not only with the Jewish customers, who bought various small things from us, but also with the {{< var goyishe >}} customers. She understood who could be given a loan, and who could not. And she behaved such that people in the town had a great respect for her, and they still called her "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}."

A {{< var possessorka >}} without a {{< var possessieh >}}^["A farmer without a farm."]. 

{{< var Mame >}} couldn't figure out what to do with me. She was of course sure that a woman - a widow - could still raise her daughters and, as it were, stay on the right path, such that when people see them, they will see beautiful and well-behaved children.
But with a son, it was more difficult. Especially with such a little son, who was a bit over-confident and didn't show any great desire to learn...
Just like {{< var tate >}}, {{< var mame >}} also wanted me to grow up to be a {{< var mentsh >}} and to study, if not a lot, at least a little. And because of that, she took me to {{< var bt >}}, and there she put me in the {{< var heder >}} of the {{< var melamed >}} Chaim Machalies because she heard that he was a very good {{< var melamed >}} and that the children of the finest and most honorable families learn from him.

-- Look, {{< var shmuelik >}} - she announced to me - put your head down to study, you will be a scholar. A Jewish boy must be able to learn.

When we lived in {{< var bt >}}, I lived with {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}}, the father-in-law of my brother {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}, who was given the nickname {{< var katik >}} because he was as quiet as a kitten. {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}} himself promised that they would keep me at home like their own child and that nothing would go wrong. And so it was. They kept me at home like their own child and they took good care of me. But the trouble was, because I was an orphan^[his mother is alive, but this term is still used], I was watched over a little too closely. I just had to do one little thing, and I was immediately reprimanded for it:

-- This is not acceptable, {{< var shmuelik >}}. Not acceptable. Your mother is doing everything so you can be in this {{< var heder >}}, and this is how you repay her!

The truth was that I was not an ordinary boy. On the contrary, I was actually a quiet boy and I didn't catch anyone's eye too much. In addition, I always kept myself very clean and neat, and when someone gave me a new outfit, my eyes really lit up. I preserved it in such a way that it always looked brand new, as if it had come straight off the needle. What’s more - I had a tendency to sing every song that I heard in the street. As soon I heard it and immediately I was singing it. And if the song could be danced to, I danced to it.

And all the people who were so watchful over me did not want me behaving this way, and they scolded me: "What is the big deal with you? And what are you doing, dancing out of nowhere like that?" And sometimes they also brought up that I am an orphan... An orphan must not sing. An orphan should not be happy.

Also, my brother {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}, the silent {{< var katik >}}, used to come from time to time to {{< var bt >}} from the village of {{< var solovinke >}}, where he sold grain. He also reprimanded me and told me how to behave - so that everyone in the home, including his father-in-law and mother-in-law, would be able to say that I was just as quiet as him. And this, in the end, was too much for me, and I couldn't take it anymore. I also longed for my mother very much, and so I begged him, my silent brother:

-- Do me a {{< var toive >}}^[pronounced "toiveh" - literally "a good" - means a favor.] and take me back home. I've been here enough. I don't want to be here anymore. I'd rather go to the {{< var heder >}} in {{< var rybinka >}}.

I also asked my {{< var mame >}} to let me come home. And when they finally gave in to me and they brought me back to {{< var rybinka >}} and I was once again home with my {{< var mame >}}, they sent me to {{< var heder >}} with the {{< var melamed >}} {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}, and this alone meant I could not have any joy; nothing good could come of this. 

He was an angry Jew, {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}. A Jew with a red beard, a broad physique, and with two large, glaring eyes. He did not know how to speak to a student with kindness. He was always angry, and the anger always simmered in him just like in a cauldron. And when his two big eyes, the glaring ones, focused on a student, it felt like "the value of congealed/hardened mother's milk"^[well this is quite the idiom..! It's clearly not a good thing.] and the student was overwhelmed with fear.

Though I wanted to keep the promise I made to my {{< var mame >}} that I would study well in the {{< var heder >}} at {{< var rybinka >}}, I was unable to do so. It was absolutely impossible to learn anything from such a {{< var melamed >}}. We all hated him in the {{< var heder >}}. His wife, an overburdened woman, who sold apples in the market, also hated him. And her hatred towards him was not for no reason, because there rarely a day went by that he did not beat her. And always, when he hit her, she screamed with a voice as if possessed, "Save me, Jewish children! He is going to kill me, the murderer...!" Of course, I could not learn much {{< var torah >}} from such a {{< var melamed >}}. Every day in the {{< var heder >}} was a punishment for me.

And from that time I remember something, which was strongly imprinted in my memory, and I want to tell it here: This was on a hot summer day, soon after lunch. In the {{< var shtetl >}}, there was suddenly a stampede. And when the {{< var reb >}}^[Referring to {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}, {{< var reb >}} was used as a general honorific ala "Mister" and does not strictly imply the person is a Rabbi] went outside to see what was happening there, he immediately ran back inside and shouted at the top of his voice: "Come, {{< var shkotsim >}}^[pranksters, "punks"], with me!"

In a hurry, he grabbed his {{< var kapote >}} and went out quickly, and we all ran after him, wondering where he was taking us - we were afraid. We followed him and none of us said a word the whole time. And so we went until he led us all into the {{< var beit-midrash >}}^["Beit Midrash" meaning "house of study;" a place for dedicated Torah/Talmud study] and there we saw something I will never forget.

In the middle of a group of inflamed and very upset Jews stood a frightened man, Meïr the synagogue choirboy, who at that time used to go to a nearby town to pray on {{< var shabes >}} in front of the pulpit. We knew that he was the son of the {{< var rokitner >}}^[adjective, of [{{< var rokitna >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokytne,_Rivne_Oblast). According to [this bio](https://www.centropa.org/en/photo/mikhail-efimovich-medvedev-meer-haimovich-bernshtein-stage) This Rabbi's name was Haim Bernshtein.] Rabbi, and that the {{< var rybinker >}} butcher, {{< var Yehiel >}}, was his brother. He was a very young man, Meïr, and he always behaved as if he had no fear of anyone in the world. This time, however, he stood trembling in fear, and the enraged Jews shouted at him, called him the worst names, and one of them, an angry Jew, slapped him across the face.

-- You scoundrel! You {{< var okher-yisrael >}}^[derogatory term for someone who has greatly sinned.]!

But this was not enough for them, so they also forced him down and lashed him. And it didn't help to wrestle with them; Meïr could not stand alone against so many people and he had to accept the punishment that was given to him.

I did not know why the choirboy received such punishment. The other students in {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}'s {{< var heder >}} did not know either. Only when they released him and handed him over to the hands of his brother {{< var Yehiel >}}, the butcher of {{< var rybinka >}}, did we find out that he was accused of some very big crime, a sin against God. That's what they said in the {{< var shtetl >}}. They also said that his friend Leibish was also involved in the crime. The {{< var rybinker >}} rabbi's son had "modernized" and was out for "bad culture"^[In other words, he begun to assimilate and leave the community; he's gone "off the _derekh_", [as the kids say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_derech). At this point, he was already in the early stages of his [secular opera career](https://www.centropa.org/en/photo/mikhail-efimovich-medvedev-meer-haimovich-bernshtein-stage).]. Leibish should have been given the same punishment as befell the choirboy, but he ran away and nobody knew where he went.

And meanwhile, the whole town went "upside-down"^["topsy-turvy"]. Everywhere people talked about this. And {{< var reb >}} {{< var shmuel-yossel >}} was in "seventh heaven"^[This is in fact a Jewish phrase/concept. In Judaism, there are seven levels of heaven.] and he did not miss any opportunity to remind the students in the classroom of what they had seen.

"{{< var Nu >}}, {{< var shkotsim >}}," he said, stroking his red beard. "Nu, {{< var shkotsim >}}, have you seen what is done to an innocent young man when he commits a sin against God? Ha?... That's exactly how you will be beaten and cut off, when you commit a sin against God..."

This is why he had led all of us to the {{< var beit-midrash >}}: He wanted us to see it with our own eyes and to remember it...

After that, Meïr the choirboy was too ashamed to show his face in the street; he left {{< var rybinka >}}, and he never came back there again...
But heard of him again? Yes, indeed we heard a lot.<br><br>
People must have liked him a lot, because he, Meïr the choirboy, the son of the {{< var rybinka >}} Rabbi, later became a famous opera singer on the Russian stage. And he called himself [{{< var medvedev >}}](https://www.centropa.org/en/photo/mikhail-efimovich-medvedev-meer-haimovich-bernshtein-stage)^[Mikhail Efimovich Medvedev, né Meïr Haimovich/Yefimiovich(?) Bernshtein.] even then...
However, he did not forget when they beat him in the synagogue when he was caught for that offense. And when I met him, many years later, in America, we both laughed a lot when we talked about it. But I will tell you about this when I reach that point^[This point will be reached in [Chapter 22](./22_1946-11-30.qmd)]...
