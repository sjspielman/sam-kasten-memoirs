{{< var Tate >}}'s death shook our entire family to the core, and nothing could ever be as it was before. No matter how hard {{< var mame >}} worked so that we would not be in need or have to ask for help, it was never enough. The name "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}" began to sound like a joke, because a {{< var possessor >}} is a professional with means to live well.

When {{< var mame >}} lost all interest in running the property as {{< var tate >}}, she left {{< var zat >}} and moved to the {{< var shtetl >}} of {{< var rybinka >}} where my sister {{< var Batsheva >}} lived with her husband. In {{< var rybinka >}}, we opened what is called a {{< var parnaseh-shtieb >}}^[Literally translates to "livelihood house"; פרנסה שטוב] where they sell everything that you can think of - even a little drink.

{{< var Mame >}} worked very hard in the {{< var parnaseh-shtieb >}} and she was really a great {{< var eshet-chayal >}}^["woman of valor"; essentially, embodies the ideal of a Jewish woman] and knew how to get along with people - not only with the Jewish customers who bought various small things from us but also with the {{< var goyishe >}} customers. She understood who could be given a loan, and who could not. Her business acumen earned her respect and authority, and people still called her "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}."

A {{< var possessorka >}} without a {{< var possessieh >}}^["A farmer without a farm."]. 

{{< var Mame >}} couldn't figure out what to do with me. She was of course sure that a woman - a widow - could still raise her daughters and, as it were, stay on the right path, such that when people see them, they will see beautiful and well-behaved children. But with a son, it was more difficult. Especially with a son who was a little spoiled and didn't show any great desire to learn...

Just like {{< var tate >}}, {{< var mame >}} also wanted me to grow up to be a {{< var mentsh >}} and to study, if not a lot, at least a little. Because of that, she sent me to {{< var bt >}} to join the {{< var heder >}} of the {{< var melamed >}} Chaim Machalies. She had heard he was a very good {{< var melamed >}} whom children of the finest and most honorable families studied under. 

"Look, {{< var shmuelik >}}," she announced to me. "Put your head down and study, and you will be a scholar. A Jewish boy must be able to learn."

During my time in {{< var bt >}}, I lived with {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}}^[Again, his name was probably not Shmuel but Isaiah-Leyb], my brother {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}'s father-in-law. {{< var shmuel-pekelis >}} himself promised to watch over me like his own child and that I'd be well cared for. They did take good care of me, but the trouble was, because I was an orphan^[while his mother is alive, but this term was still used for anyone with a deceased father], I was watched over a little too closely. I only had to do small thing and I'd be immediately reprimanded for it: "This is not acceptable, {{< var shmuelik >}}. Not acceptable. Your mother is doing everything so you can be in this {{< var heder >}}, and this is how you repay her!"

The truth is, I was not an ordinary boy. On the contrary, I was actually a quiet boy, and I didn't draw too much attention to myself. I always kept myself very clean and neat. Whenever someone gave me a new outfit, my eyes really lit up. I preserved it so it always looked brand new, as if it had come straight off the needle. I also had a tendency to sing every song that I heard in the street. As soon I heard it, I was immediately singing it. And you could dance to the song, I danced to it too.

And all the people who were watching me under a magnifying glass didn't want me behaving this way, and they scolded me, "What is the big deal with you? What are you doing, dancing out of nowhere like that?" Sometimes they also brought up that I am an orphan... An orphan should not sing. An orphan should not be happy.

My brother {{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}, nicknamed {{< var katik >}} because he was as quiet as a kitten, used to come from time to time to {{< var bt >}} from the village of {{< var solovinke >}} where he lived and sold grain. He also scolded me and lectured me that I should behave so that everyone, including his inlaws, could say that I was just as quiet as he was. 

In the end, it was all too much for me, and I couldn't take it anymore. I also longed for my mother very much, and so I begged him, "Do me a favor and take me back home. I've been here enough. I can't stay here any longer. I'd rather go to the {{< var heder >}} in {{< var rybinka >}}."

I also asked my {{< var mame >}} to let me come home. When they finally gave in and let me go back to {{< var rybinka >}} to live with my {{< var mame >}}, I was sent to {{< var heder >}} with the local {{< var melamed >}} {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}. This alone ruined any joy from being home I might have had. Nothing good could come from this man.

He was an angry Jew, {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}. A Jew with a red beard, a broad physique, and with two large, glaring eyes. He did not know how to speak to a student with kindness. He was always angry, and the anger always simmered in him just like in a cauldron. And when his two big glaring eyes focused in on you, you felt them pierce your soul^[The actual phrase Sam uses here is an idiom that is quite hard to translate: "you felt like he was curdling your mother's milk"] and you became overwhelmed with terror.

Though I wanted to keep my promise to {{< var mame >}} to study well in the {{< var heder >}} in {{< var rybinka >}}, I was unable to do so. It was absolutely impossible to learn anything from such a {{< var melamed >}}. We all hated him in the {{< var heder >}}. His wife too, who sold apples in the market, hated him like a spider^[presumably an idiom, she hates him like one hates spiders]. Her hatred towards him was not unfounded. Hardly a day went by that he did not beat her. When he hit her, she screamed with a voice as if possessed, "Save me, Jewish children! He is going to kill me, the murderer...!" Of course, I could not learn much {{< var torah >}} from such a {{< var melamed >}}. Every day in the {{< var heder >}} was a punishment for me.

There is something in particular I remember from those dayas, vividly imprinted in my memory, that I'd like to share: This was on a hot summer day, soon after lunch. Suddenly there was something like a stampdede through the {{< var shtetl >}}. When the {{< var shmuel-yossel >}} went outside to see what was happening, he immediately ran back inside and shouted loudly: "Come, {{< var shkotsim >}}^[pranksters, "punks"], with me!"

In a hurry, he grabbed his kaftan and ran out, and we all ran out after him wondering where he was taking us, afraid of where it would be. We followed him, none of us saying a single word, to the {{< var beit-midrash >}}^["Beit Midrash" meaning "house of study;" a place for dedicated Torah/Talmud study] where we saw something I will never forget.

??????????????????????????????????????????In the middle of a group of inflamed and angry Jews stood a frightened man, Meïr the synagogue choirboy, who in those days led {{< var shabes >}} prayers in a town nearby. He was the son of the {{< var rokitner >}}^[adjective for [{{< var rokitna >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokytne,_Rivne_Oblast)] Rabbi, and his brother {{< var Yehiel >}} was the {{< var rybinker >}} butcher. He was a very young man, Meïr, and he always behaved as if he had no fear of anyone in the world. This time, however, he stood trembling in fear, and the enraged Jews shouted at him, called him the worst names, and one of them, an angry Jew, slapped him across the face.

-- You scoundrel! You {{< var okher-yisrael >}}^[derogatory term for someone who has greatly sinned.]!

But this was not enough for them, so they also forced him down and lashed him. And it didn't help to wrestle with them; Meïr could not stand alone against so many people and he had to accept the punishment that was given to him.

I did not know why the choirboy received such punishment. The other students in {{< var shmuel-yossel >}}'s {{< var heder >}} did not know either. Only when they released him and handed him over to the hands of his brother {{< var Yehiel >}}, the butcher of {{< var rybinka >}}, did we find out that he was accused of some very big crime, a sin against God. That's what they said in the {{< var shtetl >}}. They also said that his friend Leibish was also involved in the crime. The {{< var rybinker >}} rabbi's son had "modernized" and was out for "bad culture"^[In other words, he begun to assimilate and leave the community; he's gone "off the _derekh_", [as the kids say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_derech). At this point, he was already in the early stages of his [secular opera career](https://www.centropa.org/en/photo/mikhail-efimovich-medvedev-meer-haimovich-bernshtein-stage).]. Leibish should have been given the same punishment as befell the choirboy, but he ran away and nobody knew where he went.

And meanwhile, the whole town went "upside-down"^["topsy-turvy"]. Everywhere people talked about this. And {{< var reb >}} {{< var shmuel-yossel >}} was in "seventh heaven"^[This is in fact a Jewish phrase/concept. In Judaism, there are seven levels of heaven.] and he did not miss any opportunity to remind the students in the classroom of what they had seen.

"{{< var Nu >}}, {{< var shkotsim >}}," he said, stroking his red beard. "Nu, {{< var shkotsim >}}, have you seen what is done to an innocent young man when he commits a sin against God? Ha?... That's exactly how you will be beaten and cut off, when you commit a sin against God..."

This is why he had led all of us to the {{< var beit-midrash >}}: He wanted us to see it with our own eyes and to remember it...

After that, Meïr the choirboy was too ashamed to show his face in the street; he left {{< var rybinka >}}, and he never came back there again...
But heard of him again? Yes, indeed we heard a lot.<br><br>
People must have liked him a lot, because he, Meïr the choirboy, the son of the {{< var rybinka >}} Rabbi, later became a famous opera singer on the Russian stage. And he called himself [{{< var medvedev >}}](https://www.centropa.org/en/photo/mikhail-efimovich-medvedev-meer-haimovich-bernshtein-stage)^[Mikhail Efimovich Medvedev, né Meïr Haimovich/Yefimiovich(?) Bernshtein.] even then...
However, he did not forget when they beat him in the synagogue when he was caught for that offense. And when I met him, many years later, in America, we both laughed a lot when we talked about it. But I will tell you about this when I reach that point^[This point will be reached in [Chapter 22](./22_1946-11-30.qmd)]...
