Considering everything that happened at the time, you'd think I would have remembered more from when the tsar Alexander the Second was killed. This happened in 1881, when I was 12 years old - "approaching 13" as we used to say in Ukraine. But there isn't a single thing left in my memory about that important event in Russian history. And if I used to know something, I covered it up and don't remember it.

I also remember very little of the pogroms that came after the tsar was killed, in 1881 and 1882 when Alexander the Third ascended the throne. Jews started fleeing Russia wherever their eyes could see because it was no longer safe to stay. I only remember one story from the time of the pogroms.

I remember how one day in {{< var rybinka >}}, we suddenly heard the church bells ringing. That alone was enough to strike fear into our hearts. And suddenly, the farmers^[the {{< var goyishe >}} farmers] came from all around the village to the church. Many farmers also came from the neighboring village of {{< var solovinke >}} across the river. They all started arriving from the other shore and went straight to the church. And when the Jews saw this, they said that nothing good could come of it. The mothers began to hide the children, and there was such panic that no one knew what to do first and where to hide.

And the bells of the church kept ringing and ringing and the more they rang, the greater the fear became, and we were certain we wouldn't be able to escape the impending calamity...

But it turned out differently; The {{< var goyim >}} left the church quiet and calm, and they went home without bothering anyone. We later found out why: the good priest, who was always a close friend of the Jews, saved the village. He had heard that the {{< var goyim >}} were preparing for a pogrom, and he swore to do whatever he could to prevent it. He did not want there to be a pogrom or for Jewish blood to be shed for no reason. So, he rang the bells to call the {{< var goyim >}} to the church, and he gave them a speech that God would punish them severely for such a sin. This affected them so much that they left the church and returned home quietly and calmly; They didn't bother the Jews in the village, and there was no pogrom.

The Jews in {{< var rybinka >}} then breathed more freely. They thanked God for the great miracle that happened, and they treated the good priest like a {{< var tzaddik >}}. But people were not entirely sure whether he'd always be able to protect us from a pogrom. We began to hear rumors that so-and-so had left for America, and so-and-so had his eye on leaving for America. But when they talked about it, they didn't say that they had left for America, but that they had _fled_ to America. You never traveled to or visited America - you _escaped_ to America.

Every letter that arrived from America was usually passed around for all to see, and people talked about the letter as if it was the most important news that happened. In particular, when a picture of someone who had "escaped to America" arrived, everyone was excited and simply couldn't tear their eyes away from it. "You can't even recognize them...," they would say. "They've become completely different people in America... They live there like noblemen...!"

Our family as well started talking about going to America. My oldest sister, {{< var Batsheva >}}, was the first to go to America with her husband. They settled in Philadelphia. Even though it was clear from the letters they wrote us that they weren't making much money, we still started to prepare for the journey to join them. At that time, {{< var mame >}} said quite openly that we would not stay in Russia - she would take her children and take us all to America.

{{< var Mame >}} struggled to bring in enough money from the {{< var parnaseh-shtieb >}} she ran in {{< var rybinka >}}. In general, it was very difficult for Jews in Russia when Alexander the Third sat on the throne. We were not allowed to do what we wanted. So many things were forbidden for Jews, and we were at the mercy of the _pristav_^[the tsarist Russia governance police superintendent] and sometimes the _sotski_^[the tsarist Russia local police].

{{< var Mame >}} continued to act like the kind of person she had been - the successful business owner - and that we wanted for nothing, and she should still be thought of as "{{< var Feige >}} the {{< var Possessorka >}}." But there were times when we couldn't afford basic necessities. We all worked in the {{< var parnaseh-shtieb >}} - {{< var mame >}}, my three sisters, and me^[Recall, there are six children: two boys and four girls. So far, one boy ({{< var itzhik-gedolia >}}) and one girl ({{< var Batsheva >}}) have married]. There was always work to do in the {{< var parnaseh-shtieb >}}, but there no {{< var parnaseh >}}^[income, livelihood]. {{< var Mame >}} always worked hard to pay off her debts and ensure we didn't owe anyone anything.

So we struggled for a couple of years until my sister {{< var Batsheva >}} started writing letters from America that things were getting better. Then, {{< var mame >}} sold the house and everything she could, and she took us, her four children, with her to America. This was, I believe, in the year 1885, and at that time I was already 16 or 17 years old. And I was very happy that we were going to America, and I bragged about it to all my friends, "You just wait and see! In America I'll make a life for myself!"

But truthfully, I didn't know myself would I would do in America. I didn't even have the faintest idea of what the theater really was at that time. The only piece of "theater" that drifted through my mind from time to time was the scene that the {{< var badchen >}} {{< var shakhnes-full >}} performed with his son-in-law at my older brother's wedding. It nagged at me, to think that if only they had let me, I could have done it even better; It occurred to me then, perhaps when I'm older I could be a {{< var badchen >}} and perform at weddings. I'd show them what I could do and then, in time, I'd become a second {{< var shakhnes-full >}} in America...

I couldn't have imagined a better entertainer than {{< var shakhnes-full >}} at that time. So I thought, the best thing I could do was follow in his footsteps. Before leaving for America, I'd often sing the song that I heard him sing:

> Make merry, pauper,
>
> enjoy yourself, poor man;
>
> He who has nothing,
>
> really has it all.


It was good for me; I dreamed of a happy life in America, even before I arrived there. And when another friend asked me why I was so eager to go to America, I had one answer: "What are you talking about? It will be as I told you - none of your business!" And I said this in good fun; I didn't get angry with anyone.

We fled to America just as thousands and thousands of other Jews did; We crossed the border in "blackness"^[specifically means they illegally crossed the border]. That's what people called it when they snuck to get passports while hiding from the special officers who patrolled the border at night.

And I still remember that when we crossed the border and we arrived at Brod^[Yiddish name for Brody, Ukraine. At this time, the city was part of Poland.], we had trouble with our agent, because he didn't want to let us take our suitcases without more money^[a bribe]. This made {{< var mame >}} angry - she said this was murderous and violent. But it didn't help at all, and we had to give the agent more money.

It is impossible to describe the troubles that poor Jewish travelers had at the borders in those years when they "escaped to America." But it was still better than it is now^[Recall this is being written in 1946 when there are many Jewish refugees with nowhere to go after the Holocaust]; You didn't have to have a visa, nobody needed a passport, and you could go wherever you wanted...

On the way, we waited for a little while in the German city of Bremen, and then we, along with many other Jews, were put on a ship. "Elbe," I remember, was the name of that ship. We {{< var schlepped >}} ourselves across the sea for two and a half weeks until we finally arrived in America. This was on a hot summer day, and when I saw the city of New York for the first time in my life, I opened my mouth and ears; I literally swallowed everything I saw with my eyes, and the strongest and best impression it made on me was how people walked around the city dressed so beautifully...

I liked this very much and I envied them all. Happy people. Even during the weekdays, they dress up like it's {{< var yontif >}}... Can there be any greater happiness in life?...

That's what I thought then, because even from a young age I liked to dress nicely and keep myself neat. I always wanted to do something that could make my daily life more like a {{< var yontif >}}, and that's why I probably became an actor...

We were not in New York for a long time, not even a few hours. From there, we left on a train to Philadelphia, where my sister {{< var Batsheva >}} lived with her husband. And as usual, in the first few days, the happiness was great. After that, people started thinking about what one can do in America to "make a living." As it turned out, that the best thing I could to "make a living," in America, was - selling bundles of matches in the streets...

When I heard this, my eyes immediately went dark.

-- What do you mean, selling matches in the streets?! Why did I come to America?

But it didn't help at all; Everyone made me understand that, in America, first of all you have to get the {{< var meshugas >}} out of your head, and second, everyone here has to work, because otherwise you can't "climb the economic ladder." Other than that, you don't have to worry about anything in America. The main thing is to earn money and make a living...

And this is how it happened: They hung a cash register around my neck. A cash register with a box of matches. I was placed on South Fifth Street^[At this time, the Jewish district in Philadelphia was roughly Locust - Christian, 8th - Front. The stretch of Bainbridge between 4th-5th was a market, so I imagine {{< var sam >}} was around that area.] and ordered to walk back and forth and exclaim aloud: "Parlor matches, t'ree^["three"] for five! Parlor matches, t'ree for five!" the whole time...

The foreign words did not roll off my tongue, even though I learned them well before. I ended up styled them in my own way and it came out something like, "Palner mentsh't is priper fieft!"

But it didn't take more than a couple of days for me to learn those first English words I knew in America. I had to have a new livelihood, and I was already calling out my goods like a happy merchant, hanging around with a cash box on South Fifth Street in Philadelphia: "Parlor matches, t'ree for five!"

This was my first income in America. And I've already "made a living" and I was already "alright."
