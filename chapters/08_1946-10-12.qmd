Making the acquaintance of Mogulesko bewildered/dazed me so much, that I couldn't take working in the shop at all. Everything I saw of him on stage always floated before my eyes. I remembered every movement he made, every expression that appeared on his face. His unique "stage grace," which really has no equal, was so deeply engraved in my memory that I could never forget it. And because I was always thinking so much about Mogulesko and the show he played in Philadelphia, I started to yearn to act in the theater even more than before.
I simply wanted to begin my life as an actor. The stage cast a spell on me. But every time, when I started talking about this at home, _mame_ would cut off my wings:

-- Get this stupidity out of your head - she said. - Like we don't have enough actors in the family...^[I am not entirely confident in this translation, but I think it is roughly correct at least in terms of the sentiment. She may be referring to Bessie Thomashefshky, who has already run away with Boris - and is her niece.]

It was difficult for me to cause _mame_ such grief; I have always behaved so that she should not suffer any shame from me. In this case, however, I could not obey her, as I had firmly made up my mind that, should there even be thunder and lightning, I must be an actor!

A short time after Mogulesko left, the actor [Jacob Gartenstein](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/G/gartenstein-jacob.htm) arrived in Philadelphia with a troupe, and when I heard that, I was very interested and knew that I should go talk to him about me and convince him to give me an opportunity to play some kind of role. He was a very unique person, Jacob Gartenstein, and it will not be excessive to mention here some details of his biography:

He is from Ukraine, and he came to America after the first pogroms of 1881 and 1882. He was one of the first Jewish actors that Goldfaden recruited when he created the Yiddish theater. And the other actors considered him to be an educated man; He spoke very good English and he also spoke Russian, German and French. That's what they said. He was associated with the Jewish theater for a few years and even though he was not one of the great actors, he was an ____^[Word does not translate: אויפטוער], indeed a bit of a swindler, too^[Indeed, Gartenstein was arrested in Philadelphia in 1888 for cheating people out of money and not paying debts.]. And when he realized he wouldn't make it big on the stage, he suddenly opened a beer saloon in Philadelphia and it didn't go poorly. But for some reason, which he kept secret, he had to give up the beer saloon and he left Philadelphia for Chicago.

And what did he do in Chicago? 

There, he completely turned away from the Yiddish theater and began to play the role of an intellectual, of the philosopher, and he became the president of some lodge, which bore the name of the famous philosopher Spinoza, and he gave lectures. And at the same time, he got involved with politics - with American politics. And once he was even a candidate for Congress^[See Illinois 5 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections#Illinois">this wikipedia article</a>. Also, it was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contested-Election-Jacob-Gartenstein-Adolph-Sabath/dp/0265117615">contested election!</a>.] and during the race he gave fiery "campaign speeches"^[קאַמפּעין–ספּיטשעס]. But he was not elected.

After the First World War, he suddenly started calling himself "Dr. Gartenstein." But he was not a doctor of medicine, neither a doctor of philosophy, nor of any other field... 
And he died in Chicago. Died suddenly of a heart attack.

All around, he was a very interesting character, Jacob Gartenstein; Fifty-sixty years ago^[This was written in 1946, so 56 years ago was 1890.], he was one of the pillars on which the Jewish community in America stood. When writing about the Yiddish theater of the old days, you have to mention him. And I have to mention him for myself too, because he was connected with my career on the Yiddish stage in America and he gave me my first role to play in a show.

At that time, Gartenstein was playing Goldfaden's play _The Sorceress_ in Philadelphia. The troupe consisted of several distinguished people, and among them, I remember, was [Yosef Wachtel](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/V/vakhtel-yosef.htm)^[Recall he was in the play _Shulamith_ where Sam was an extra in <a href="https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten/chapters/06_1946-10-03.html">Chapter 6</a>.], [Mendele Abramovich](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/A/abramovich-max.htm), [Feyvele Fridman](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/F/fridman-feyvele.htm) and [Mendel Teplitzky](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/teplitzky-mendel.htm); Like many other Yiddish theater directors who traveled around the provinces^[This term is used generally to refer to areas of the country that are outside the big cities.], Gartenstein also relied on the fact that he would soon find enough "_haimishe_ talent"^[homegrown/local talent] among the young Jewish boys and girls who wanted to act in the theater in Philadelphia. I, too, was one of them^[And likely so was Suzie, his future wife; she also played with Gartenstein in Philadelphia although we do not have as many details on her life.], and for _The Sorceress_, he gave me the role of the young little scoundrel Elyokum^[the witch's servant], who twists the old witch's head and is always tricking her out of money.


When he gave a copy of the role, he told me, that I should memorize it well so that I will remember everything by heart, and as he thought that I already had experience also the stage, he did not consider it necessary to explain to me what a _replik_^[refers to a theater "cue", as in you say your line on your cue.] was. I went home and I learned by the few written pages by heart, and when I came to the rehearsals, I called out all my lines at once, and I thought that I did well.

Everyone laughed, and I didn't understand why they were laughing at the fact that I knew my whole role by heart. Only when Gartenstein explained to me what a _replik_ was - he told me that this was the last line someone else said and that afterwards I had to pick up the prose and speak my lines - I began to understand the problem. And then things went so there was no more need to laugh at me.


In general, people learned to act not before they went up on the stage, but only after they had already become a professional actor; All the talents that came to the Yiddish stage at that time were what is called _"samorodne"_^[means authentic, genuine]; They didn't go to any dramatic schools, they didn't study anywhere, but they were drawn to the stage and playing theater had such an appeal for them, and they were so enchanted by it that no force in the world could turn them away from it.



At the time, my performance was highly commended, so I was told. I, too, was pleased with how I played the little con artist, who twists the old sorceress' head and cheats her out of money. I was even more pleased that, through performing the part, I realized how beautiful Goldfaden’s play was. I liked the whole play so much that even when I wasn't on stage, I positioned myself behind the scenes so that I wouldn't miss seeing a single scene and that I could hear the songs they sang well.

And even now everything seems alive before my eyes and I hear the singing. The butcher also comes out on the stage, a healthy young man, a man of iron, and even before he opened his mouth, everyone in the theater already knew what he will soon sing and they all know the melody very well; They know the tune because they've seen Goldfaden's play more than once, and all the _nigunim_^[songs] in the play are so close to their hearts that they would listen to each song over and over again. They are very fond of these _nigunim_ and they would often sing them to themselves - at home, in the shop at work, and everywhere. They are familiar with all roles. And when they see the butcher on the stage, they nudge one another with their elbows and this meant: Soon you will hear, there will soon be a song...

And soon they indeed heard:

_Lyrics in Yiddish that are too complicated & poetic for me to translate._



The faces of the entire audience in the theater lit up with joy. They are so pleased that they hear exactly what they wanted, and the singing continues...

_Lyrics_.

The audience in the theater knows that this is not the end of the song. But you can't help but applaud. And the actor, who plays the butcher, realizes that now the audience is in fully engaged and  he continues to sing:

_Lyrics_.

The audience _kvelled_ and really came alive with this song. And every time when an actor on stage excelled with a song, the others in the troupe were very jealous of them, and they waited anxiously, looking forward to the moment when they would also be able to show what they could do, how they could be even better in front of the audience. And when it came to the popular song _Bobkelach_^[as in _bupkis_!], there were already people in the theater who couldn't resist the temptation and sang along:

_Lyrics_.

In singing the song _Bobkelach_, Gartenstein borrowed a little poem/verse from a well-known _chazan_ in Philadelphia. And he sang it in such a way that it was really a pleasure to listen to:

_Lyrics_.


In particular after the part in the marketplace where everyone starts singing "Buy, buy customers," and then the great show become even grander, when Hotsmakh came around with his little tune:

_Lyrics_.


And after a little bit, another song:

_Lyrics_.

Together with the audience, I was so moved by the performance, both on stage and behind the curtain, that I felt like I was in seventh heaven, and when I danced so unexpectedly in the role of Elyokum, it wasn't because I was supposed to dance like that, but because of what was right in my heart at the time...

At that performance in Philadelphia, all of my family were there, and my _mame_ was among them. They all said that I was very good in the role of the scoundrel Elyokum. But I really wanted to know what my _mame_ had to say about it. And when I asked her how she liked me in the role, she just waved her hand.

-- Know what I think!... You are _meshuga_^[he's acting crazy], that's all...

She had nothing more to say about it. Frankly, I resented this. What does it mean I'm _meshuga_?... I played theater, showed everyone that I was an actor and she says I am _meshuga_!
