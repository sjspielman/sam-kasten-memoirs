![[This article entitled "{{< var mogu >}} speaks!"](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/dywt/1903/09/03/01/article/13) appeared on the front page of the September 3rd, 1903 edition of {{< var velt >}}. It reads:<br><br>**{{< var mogu >}} speaks**<br>_He came to the {{< var velt >}} to deny the false rumors._<br>Malicious gossip has been circulating that the famous comedian {{< var mogu-full >}}, the _liebling_ of the Yiddish stage, is still as ill as he was and still cannot speak. We find it necessary to thoroughly and categorically disavow these rumors. {{< var mogu >}} is healthy and lively, and his voice sounds just as good as it was in the old days. Last night he came to the office of {{< var velt >}} and asked us to tell the Jewish community of New York that he is alright. "I live," he said, "and I speak as I used to. The community of New York can be assured of this."](../img/newspaper_clippings/1903-09-03_di-yidishe-velt.png){width="2.75in"}


We waited for so long until, at long last, it finally happened. On one beautiful morning, as they say in the stories, the news suddenly broke - that {{< var mogu >}} had regained his voice, and he was already speaking and can again perform.<br><br>
It was such a wonderful miracle! While sitting in the park, pensive and preoccupied, {{< var mogu >}} tried to get a word out of his mouth, as he often did since losing since voice. He would always do this when he was alone, but usually he wasn't ever able to get the words of his mouth and past his lips. He didn't strain to hear the words, or even an echo of the word he tried say; there was nothing for him to hear. No voice came from his lips. But this time, to his great joy, he did hear a voice - his own voice, which he hadn't heard before when he had tried to speak. And when he heard it he didn't believe it at first, so he started to test it out again and again. And when he was finally sure that he was really speaking on his own and his words came out freely, no longer suppressed, he jumped up and ran home to share the news. And when, along his way home, he saw his oldest daughter across the street, he ran up to greet her with great joy:<br><br>
-- Liza! Liziku! I can talk!... Do you hear? I can talk!<br><br>
He really loved her, his older daughter - "Liziku," as he used to call her^[Her name, as written above, was "Liza."] - and he was so pleased with her because she didn't want to be an actress but preferred to get an education. During the times when he had lost his voice, he would spend hours and hours with her, and she knew how to speak to him to stave off his depression. And it's not hard to imagine how his good daughter, his loyal daughter, rejoiced when she heard her father speak.

Everyone in the {{< var mogu >}} family was overjoyed. The whole family was elated. And {{< var mogu >}} himself went on and on, gaping,

-- Do you hear? Do you hear? I can talk!

This story was later told to me many times. {{< var mogu >}} himself used to tell it over and over. And his family as well, whenever they had the chance, would tell the story as I have told it here. And I believe, that if someone writes {{< var mogu >}}'s biography, they'll have to dwell on and give a detailed account of this, and maybe even recount a lot of details that I haven't mentioned here.

As soon as {{< var edelstein-full >}} heard that {{< var mogu >}} had regained his voice and could talk again, he immediately went over to his home. And when he came back, his scowling face shone and he was in high spirits:

-- Oh yes, it's good, it's good! Long live {{< var zeligel >}} {{< var mogu >}}! He can talk again!

And indeed, soon the great news made its way around the whole Jewish community of New York. Posters were printed and posted far and wide to announce that {{< var mogu >}} will take the stage in the People's Theater. He would appear in {{< var shomer >}}'s piece {{< var immigrant >}} playing his well-known role "{{< var feitl >}}".<br><br>
And people didn't need to hear anything more. They immediately rushed to buy tickets, and on the evening of the performance^[September 3rd, 1903] the theater was so full that people were packed in like sardines, and people were crammed into the aisles^[Sam uses a phrase that must be an idiom, "hung from the walls;" this is my phrasing]. And when {{< var mogu >}} came onto the stage, they gave him such an ovation; the whole audience stood up to applaud. And this moved {{< var mogu >}} so much that he remained standing on the stage, like someone reborn, and his eyes filled with tears.

People didn't come to the theater that night to see {{< var immigrant >}} - they only came to see {{< var mogu >}} in the role of "{{< var feitl >}}". Indeed, that's what they mostly said when they came to buy tickets for {{< var shomer >}}'s {{< var immigrant >}} - they said they were buying the tickets just to see {{< var mogu >}} play "{{< var feitl >}}".

It was usually like that in those days - whenever {{< var mogu >}} performed, his acting caused such commotion stirred up such enthusiasm in the audiences, that nobody cared what play was being put on when it was announced that {{< var mogu >}} would appear in it - they only cared that he was appearing in it. The specific play being put on wasn't the point, only what role {{< var mogu >}} was playing. He would often add his own artistic flair to the role. In everything he did on the stage, he was so full of charm and exuded such warmth and love, that people wanted to see him play over and over again, and when they saw him again, they were still just as enthusiastic. 

{{< var mogu >}} brought such mastery to his roles with his own unique kind of intonation, that the audiences picked it up and "sang" it everywhere they went just as you would pick up a beautiful {{< var nigun >}} that you loved to sing along to. 

Every little word that he said in a role, or that he snuck in on his own, usually became very popular with the audiences. After a show, you'd hear people reciting them everywhere - in the street, at home, in the shop; It was etched in your memory and you couldn't forget it, and when someone would merely say a word of it, you saw before you the essense of {{< var mogu >}}, and that alone was enough to make your face shine with joy...

No other actor could ever make lines in a play as popular with the audience as {{< var mogu >}} used to be able to. No one ever did it and no one ever could do it, because there was only **one** {{< var mogu >}}.

{{< var mogu >}} didn't perform more than once a week. This is what his doctor ordered, and he obeyed his doctor. He only performed twice a week when there was no other option, but never more than that. And the actors in the troupe worried over him and were always ready to do anything for him to give him a little bit of joy. 

The few performances he played that season in People's Theater were usually those from the old repertoire. He appeared in several roles which, in years past, he had made famous and beloved by the whole Jewish world^[Indeed, {{< var mogu >}} originated the role of [Schmendrik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmendrik), which in turn became a word/trope in Yiddish and now even English - all because of his acting.]. Once, when the decision was made to put on {{< var goldfaden >}}'s {{< var kuni >}}, he requested that I play the second {{< var kuni-lemel >}} - the fake one^[There is no record of this performance I can find in the papers between 1903--1906 (but that doesn't mean it didn't happen, of course). In addition, we know from newspaper cross-referencing that, by the time {{< var mogu >}} regained his speech, Sam had in fact already left the People's Theater for the Windsor Theater (which he will describe in subsequent chapters), so the chronology is somewhat out of order here.].

I was really very moved by this. It was a great honor that {{< var mogu >}} himself requested that I play the second {{< var kuni-lemel >}}, and I prepared for the performance as though it were a great {{< var simcha >}}. And at the same time, I was scared stiff and afraid that, playing alongside him on stage, the audiences wouldn't care about me at all, or compared to him I'd look like a fool.

It's no small thing to act alongside {{< var mogu >}} in {{< var kuni >}}!

At the rehearsals, I closely watched his every little gesture, trying to catch even the smallest little detail. Afterwards, I practiced them all carefully and tried with all my might to imitate the charming tricks he added to the role.

But I was still very worried about it. And {{< var edelstein >}} was always reminding me - 

-- Remember, {{< var boyele >}}! You're playing the second {{< var kuni-lemel >}} with {{< var mogu >}}... You have to gird yourself... Yes, yes, anyone who plays with him needs to gird themselves...

The evening of the performance I was so nervous, as though it were my very first time on the stage. And when the scene where I meet him - the real {{< var kuni-lemel >}} - arrived, and I saw him in all his wretchedness and pitifulness - which itself contained a whole world of charm - my eyes suddenly burst with joy and I couldn't remember a thing of what I was supposed to do, as I looked at him and he looked back at me in just the same way...

And this was how it should be. This was a good was to play the role of the second {{< var kuni-lemel >}}, because the real {{< var kuni-lemel >}} should get all mixed up and then be able to say his famous line, which usually made the audiences laugh:

-- If I didn't know that I was me, I would think that you are me and I am you...

What happened that evening in the theater was indescribable. Exactly like in other performances that {{< var mogu >}} appeared in in the People's Theater after he regained his voice, the audience was packed in like sardines. It was not only his old fans who remembered him from before who came to see him, but also new fans, and among them were highly intelligent leading theater-connoisseurs who really appreciated geniune talent. And when {{< var mogu >}} came out on the stage, he said a few words and gave a short speech. I will never forget that he began by talking about me; with a loving little smile on his face, he said:

-- You must understand - every time I play {{< var kuni-lemel >}}, I have {{< var tsures >}}^[problems, difficulties] because the fake {{< var kuni-lemel >}} always hams it up too much and ends up overshadowing my own playing. But Kestin doesn't, and that is good. 

In general, he praised me when he was called on stage between acts to say a few words. It was such a pleasure for me, and I felt so happy and valued.

I will never for the rest of my life forget that performance with {{< var mogu >}}, being on the same stage with him and seeing his artistic talent and creative process up close with my own eyes. {{< var mogu >}}'s whole being was a wonder on the Yiddish stage. Truly a miracle. He was an ordinary man, without much of an education, without any familiarity with acting theory or formal technique, and he didn't know the history of the world stage. He didn't know any of these things, and he didn't need to. He had little interest even in the praise he received when people wrote about his acting. It seemed that this didn't do much for him. But he was so full of talent that.... _The rest of this paragraph is too blurry to translate. I will need to get a new scan of this section of the chapter and try again._

It's also worth recounting what {{< var jacob-adler >}}, the {{< var nesher >}} himself, used to say about {{< var mogu >}}:

-- {{< var mogu >}} can make even the most foolish role sparkle and shine like a diamond.... He is such an artist that he can take a "crappy play" and give it such an ingenious jolt that when you look at the play after, you'll see a real work of art...

There is only one {{< var mogu >}} on our Yiddish stage. There has never been another who can compare to him...
