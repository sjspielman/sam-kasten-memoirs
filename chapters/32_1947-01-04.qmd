> {{< var dora-full >}} and I in the roles of {{< var piye >}} and {{< var shmiye >}}. -- {{< var kessler-full >}}'s expert opinion about a play. -- How {{< var mogu >}} taught me to perform a role.



::: {layout-ncol="2"}

{{< var shpachner >}} opened the season^[1905/1906] in the {{< var kalich >}} Theater^[formerly known as the Windsor Theater] with a piece written by the actor {{< var feinman-full >}} called {{< var sobi >}}^[Sobietsky was a [John III Sobieski, the King of Poland from 1629-1696](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_III_Sobieski). Sam is not correct about the debut: This play did not open the season, but rather premiered in December 1905, as shown in the advertisement to the right. It is possible to further speculate on why he was mistaken about the premiere date. The first reason, of course, is that this occurred over 40 years ago in Sam's life relative to when he wrote his memoirs. The second reason is that Sam was likely ill at the time suffering from severe stomach cramping (cause unknown to us), and his debilitating pain may have influenced his recollection of this time of his life. We know he was suffering because of this [article/advertisement from March 9th, 1907](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/dwt/1907/03/09/01/article/50.4) where he describes his chronic illness - and how the doctors in the Vienna Medical Office on 106 E 11th St cured him when no one else was able to. Indeed, it seems Sam became somewhat of a celebrity spokesperson for the Viennese doctors, with the same article/advertisement reprinted in future newspapers (both in {{< var vahr >}} and other newspapers) to further promote the medical institute.]. The old Yiddish actor {{< var feinman-full >}} really loved to write plays. It wasn't enough for him to be an actor; he really wanted to be a playwright too. But in Yiddish theater circles, it was said that, once when he wrote a play, he wanted {{< var kessler-full >}} to play the lead role. But he knew that {{< var kessler >}} didn't think highly of his writing so of course he wouldn't want to hear about his play. So, {{< var feinman >}} made up a story that he had actually translated the play from Russian, and it was it was originally written by {{< var gorky >}}. [{{< var gorky-full >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky)^[This anecdote provides some context for why {{< var feinman >}} did not originally ascribe his name to {{< var sobi >}}.]...<br><br>
He wanted to ensure that {{< var kessler >}} would listen to the whole play, because he knew that the great artist {{< var kessler-full >}} really held {{< var gorky >}} in high esteem... But as soon as he read the first few pages, {{< var kessler >}} began to frown. Shrugging his shoulders, he grimaced, and you could tell that he was puzzled and something did not sit right with him. And when he finished reading the first act, he grabbed {{< var feinman >}} by the shoulders with both hands and stared sharply at him with his two big eyes, and he roared:<br><br>
-- _{{< var feinman >}}-oiniye_^[a nickname], you wrote this masterpiece, not {{< var gorky >}}! You did - not {{< var gorky >}}! To the devil with you!...<br><br>
The great artist, who was hardly educated, nevertheless had the good sense to know when someone was trying to pull a fast one. He immediately saw that {{< var gorky >}} could not have written this. And when {{< var feinman >}} was admitted that he was the real author, {{< var kessler >}} said:<br><br>
-- {{< var Nu >}}, of course it was you!... I knew it...Only someone who thinks with their knees and writes with their elbows could have written such a thing...

![Advertisement for the debut of the play from [from December 30th, 1905 in {{< var arb >}}](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/derarbeiter/1905/12/30/01/article/12); see translation in footnote[^advert] below. Amusingly, the play was _not_ originally advertised as being written by {{< var feinman >}}. Instead, the playwright advertised was "Professor Yakoby of London," who was not a real person. This was a pseudonym sometimes used in the early Yiddish theater by playwrights who either did not want to be associated with a {{< var shund >}} play, or when the theater putting on the play did not want to pay royalties to the actual playwright because the play was illegally obtained (Source: Volume 2 pg 295 of the {{< var leks >}}). After this play became a hit (albeit relatively short-lived), it seems that {{< var feinman >}} _did_ later put his name to the play.](../img/newspaper_clippings/1905-12-30_arb.png){width="2.75in"}

This is how he usually spoke about a play that he didn't like, and this time he was even more biting...

But {{< var feinman >}} was not deterred by the fact that {{< var kessler-full >}} did not care for his writing, and he kept writing plays. And when someone put on one of his plays, he was in the seventh heaven. He didn't care about what "royalties" he would get, just that he wasn't only an actor - but also a playwright...

{{< var feinman >}} did well with his play {{< var sobi >}}. This play was a great success in the {{< var kalich >}} Theater and it was played for two more seasons. It goes without saying that the lead role of the great Rabbi who stands up for the Jews was played by {{< var feinman >}} himself, since he loved the role very much and he was sure that no other actor would play it as well as him.

In the play, {{< var dora-full >}} and I again played as a couple, and it was just as {{< var shpachner >}} promised - we had enough to sing and say and dance in our roles. {{< var dora >}}'s character was named {{< var piye >}}, and mine was named {{< var shmiye >}}, and the audience greatly enjoyed the scene we played together. Everyone was lively and joyous, and the crowd went wild for {{< var piye >}} and {{< var shmiye >}}.

The lively little couple that {{< var dora-full >}} and I created in the play {{< var sobi >}} brought a lot of joy to thousands and thousands of Jews, and everywhere you went, you'd hear people talking about {{< var piye >}} and {{< var shmiye >}}. It was enough to just mention those two names for people to start laughing.

In the middle of the week in the {{< var kalich >}} Theater, we put on other plays. One of them, I remember, was called {{< var yerusha >}}, but I no longer remember the name of the playwright^[The playwright's name was George (Gershon) Zeikin; Biography available from Volume 1 page 774 of the {{< var leks >}}.] I only remember that I played the role of some kind of snub-nosed cavalier who is courting a beautiful young woman. She tells him that she will only marry him if he goes to Paris and gets himself a better nose. He does what she asks and goes to Paris to get a smaller nose, but when he returns, he is left only with his new nose,because it turns out the beautiful young woman had cheated on him - just went he left for Paris, she up and married someone else...

It goes without saying that the role of the beautiful maiden, who the snub-nosed cavalier courted and was so in love with, was played by {{< var dora-full >}}, and she brought a lot of life and humor into the role. {{< var mogu >}} wrote a little ditty for the cavalier to sing, and even now I remember the {{< var nigun >}}^[A _different_ song that Sam sang in this role was called "It's just my nose that's to blame." You can find the [sheet music here](https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200185829/) and a translation and modern-day rendition of it [here](http://www.yiddishpennysongs.com/2016/01/in-dem-iz-shuldik-nor-mayn-noz-its-just.html)]:

> I'm an orphan, a {{< var nebech >}} --
>
> I've lost the tip of my nose.
>
> And gone with it is my beautiful maiden -- Now I'm here alone.
>
> {{< var oyveyzmir >}}, my beloved little nose!
>
> {{< var oyveyzmir >}}, my beloved little nose!
>
> Gone with it is my beautiful maiden, my love,
>
> And in misery, snub-nosed, I am here alone.

In general, {{< var mogu >}} helped me out anytime I needed some kind of little song in a comical role. Whenever I asked him for one, he not only wrote it, but he practiced it with me to show me how to sing it. Not just for me, but also for other actors, {{< var mogu >}} on many occasions showed a fine, authentic collegiality. He was always ready to help you prepare for a role, to show you what to do and how to embody the character you were playing.

Once, when I appeared in "Professor" {{< var horowitz >}}'s play {{< var yingl >}}, I played the role of the {{< var shadchan >}} {{< var shlmomo-gargel >}}, a role in which {{< var mogu >}} so excelled that he simply had no equal. I asked him if he would help me prepare for this role and show me how he played it so I could imitate his acting. It was hard for me to come to him with this request, because in those days he was ill again and he rarely performed. I remembered that I thought he would of course be upset to hear I was given the role, and he would consider it insolent and tactless that I would ask him to show me how to play a role he was so excellent in.

But took it exactly the opposite way and gladly showed me how to play the role, and on the evening of the performance he came to the theater to see me and encouraged me[^mogu-blank]. Now I will recount something that reflects who {{< var mogu >}} was as an artist:

After the performance, {{< var mogu >}} told me that overall I did a good job in the role, but in the third act I made him look like a fool...

At first I didn't understand. Only when he explained to me did I realize that he was right, and I began to see why, when I left the stage at the end of the scene, no one applauded me even though the audience usually applauded at this scene.

The scene takes place in the wealthy Rabbi's home, and the {{< var shadchan >}} sees that the table drawer is open with money sitting in it. As a poor Jew, he needs money. The urge comes over him to take a little, even though he knows that stealing is a sin. He starts calling for the man of the house, "Rabbi Kalman! Come here, Rabbi Kalman!" But Rabbi Kalman is very busy, so he doesn't come. And the poor {{< var shadchan >}} cannot resist the temptation, and he grabs some coins from the open drawer and leaves.

While playing this scene, {{< var mogu >}} was fastidious about every little detail, acting even with his eyes to hold the whole audience in suspense. When he saw the open drawer, his looked at it so acutely that the whole audience was fixated on his gaze, and had no choice but to look at the drawer along with him. And when he called out for Rabbi Kalman, you could hear in his voice that he wanted the Rabbi to rescue him from sin. And he didn't call out for Rabbi Kalman one time, but instead three or four times. And after each time, when the he still didn't come, {{< var mogu >}} reached out with a trembling hand and grabbed a few coins and stashed them in his pocket, and then again called out for Rabbi Kalman. When he finished stashing all the coins away in his pocket, he left.

This is how {{< var mogu >}} used to perform this scene, which audiences really loved to see because he performed it with such a unique artistic charm. Every little movement, every dart of his eye, was precisely planned and expressed with feeling. But when I played the scene, I didn't think about it as much, and I didn't fully grasp it when he showed me how to play it. And so in the scene I simply grabbed all the money at once and left. That's why the scene went poorly and the audience didn't applaud. I didn't deserve any applause...

From then on, I knew that when {{< var mogu >}} showed me how to perform a role, or when I saw him on stage, I should not take my eyes off him for even one second, and I had to watch every little thing he did. Missing something was like losing a ring from a gold chain...

And he, the great artist, the master of character development on the Yiddish stage, was so modest that whenever he had to play a role that a different actor besides him had played before, he would go to them and ask that them to show him how to play the role. He once even came to me with such a request and asked me to show him how to play a well-known role of a butcher in some play whose name I don't remember. {{< var berl-b >}} used to play this role, and he played the butcher in his usual way, dancing a [{{< var hopke >}}](https://jewish-music.huji.ac.il/node/22232) and doing a _yom pom pom_, waving his hands around and raising them in the air. I confess, when I was given the role, I imitated {{< var bern >}} more than a little, and I told this to {{< var mogu >}} when I showed him how to play the role. And {{< var mogu >}} told me in response,

-- That's not bad, that's okay. Show me everything. Let me see.

And he watched me do it all, asking me questions about it over and over again, just as he would teach other actors how to play his roles. And when later I went to see him perform the role of the butcher, I watched with my eyes wide open because I wanted to take it all in, how {{< var mogu >}} transformed the butcher into something I had never seen before. This was truly a whole different butcher - not mine, not {{< var bern >}}'s, but a real life butcher just as you would see in a butcher shop. Even though he performed the role as I had shown him, he also made it something else entirely. And it could not have gone any other way, because nobody was as great a performer as he was. There has never been anyone else like {{< var mogu >}} on our Yiddish stage.

When you think about it, it's been more than thirty years since he passed away^[{{< var mogu >}} died in 1914, as Sam will tell us about later.], and still no one has turned his memoirs, which were published in {{< var forverts >}}, into a book. {{< var mogu >}} himself, I know, used to come to the newsroom of the {{< var forverts >}}, and he told his life story which {{< var cahan >}} wrote. But {{< var cahan >}} didn't finish it becasuse he got too busy, so he handed the writing over to {{< var gottlieb-full >}}, and I know that {{< var gottlieb >}} took it over with love, because just like {{< var cahan >}}, he was also greatly impressed by {{< var mogu >}}'s talent.

{{< var mogu >}}'s memoirs really should be published in a book, and everyone should read it. Not only Yiddish actors, but anyone who is interested in the Yiddish theater and the origins of the great Yiddish artist. Perhaps some folks at the {{< var hau >}} have thought about doing this? It would be a beautiful monument to the great artist {{< var mogu >}}, who had a profound impact and left a deep mark on the Yiddish theater not only in America, but across the whole world.

[^mogu-blank]: This event is also mentioned in {{< var mogu >}}'s {{< var leks >}} entry, as copied here from the [translation available on the Museum of Family History website](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/mogulesko-sigmund.htm):

    > Leon Blank similarly recalls: "(Sam) Kasten had to play the role of 'Shmuel Gorgel the Matchmaker' in 'Professor' Horowitz's 'Dos poylishe yingel (The Polish Youth)" -- a role, in which Mogulesko had strongly excelled in. ... Without a scrap of jealousy, with the best feeling, and with the earliest wish, Mogulesko showed Kasten how he handled the role, how he played it, and in the evening of the performance he came to the theatre. On various occasions, one could see Mogulesko's close relationship with his other colleagues. He never provided anyone with a shot. Turned out, he was always ready to help that out -demonstrating, learning, acting in a [certain] way. When he was in a play with another comedian, he saw that the latter should have no smaller role, and no less with a song, And, in fact, the songwriter himself wrote to another comedian and himself adapted the music."
