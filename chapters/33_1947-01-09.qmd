> Again in Philadelphia, and then back to New York. -- With {{< var kessler >}} in rehearsals and the parables he told in disjointed and choppy words.

At the end of the second season in the {{< var kalich >}} Theater, we were told that next year there would be no more performances there because the building was being torn down to make way for the great bridge that would connect New York with Brooklyn - now the well-known "Manhattan Bridge."

I was naturally very sorry that the Windsor Theater^[Recall, although the theater had been renamed to the {{< var kalich >}} theater, it was known before - and for a much longer time - as the Windsor] was being demolished - after all, I had made a name for myself there during the first few years I played in New York. And even to this day, when I walk past the Manhattan Bridge, I usually stop there for a moment. Somehow instinctively I pause, and I think to myself - once upon a time, the Windsor Theater stood here.

After the season^[1906/1907] ended, {{< var shor-full >}} came to me with an offer to play in Philadelphia in {{< var mike >}}'s Columbia Theater, and we agreed I would be paid $100/week. On top of that, they'd hire my wife as well and pay her $25/week. {{< var mike >}} put together a troupe in Philadelphia of big-name actors, among whom was [{{< var schwartz >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/S/schwartz-maurice.htm), the same {{< var schwartz-full >}} who later created the [Yiddish Art Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_Art_Theatre). But at that time, no one imagined that one day he would create such great things for the Yiddish stage and that he would launch a new chapter in the history of Yiddish theater in America.

Generally speaking, the Yiddish theater in Philadelphia was nowhere near the level of New York and simply could not compete with it. In Philadelphia, they would put on the same plays that were popular in New York, and they played them like there really wasn't anything to be ashamed of. It was common that a popular play would have a longer run in Philadelphia than in New York, and I remember how once, in {{< var mike >}}'s Columbia Theater^[At 3rd and Green Sts], we put on {{< var be-a-mentsh >}}^[Sheet music for [the title song](https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200182066/) of the play], which Moishe {{< var shor >}}^[{{< var shor-full >}}'s brother. An actor and playwright, his {{< var leks >}} entry has not yet been translated, but it is available from Volume 4, page 2650.] and {{< var shor-full >}} wrote together, for a record 25 weeks in a row. And we played it so well that the theater bigwigs even came down from New York to see us play it.

I played in Philadelphia for three seasons[^philly]. I achieved such renown that even people who remembered me well from the early days and called me "{{< var sam >}}ke" back when I was struggling to make a name for myself, started to call me "Mr. {{< var kestin >}}," and I had many great fans among them.

But I still yearned to be back in New York, and when I was offered a job at the [Thalia Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Theatre)^[located at 46 Bowery], I grabbed at it. At that time, there were three managers of the Thalia Theater - {{< var kessler-full >}}, {{< var boaz-full >}}, and {{< var wilner-full >}}. {{< var wilner-full >}}, who was {{< var kessler-full >}}'s second wife's son, managed the business. He was jack of many trades and handled all aspects of the theater business, but he didn't talk much. With a cigar in the corner of his mouth, he would sit around for hours and say only a few words, but that didn't mean that he had nothing to say. On the contrary, he always had an opinion about everything, and also a well-thought out plan, and usually he'd see it through and make sure it all went as he wanted.

I always loved to work with {{< var kessler-full >}}. But at the same time, I was also afraid of him because when he became capricious on the stage, or suddenly went in a rage over something, he was impossible to put up with. And when he would, in the middle of performing, start to growl his famous "No" from between his teeth with his own strange sort of sharp grunt, it freaked everyone out and completely disoriented them. I remember how one time I said to him:

-- Listen, Mr. {{< var kessler >}}, if you start to growl "No" at me one more time on the stage, I'll cause a scene!

-- A scene? - He said, glaring back at me with his two great eyes. - Pray tell, what exactly, {{< var kasey >}}^[{{< var kessler >}}'s nickname for {{< var sam >}} **Kest**in], will you do?

-- I'll yell "fire!" on the stage! - I answered.

But really, I did love working with {{< var kessler >}} because he was a great artist who knew what he wanted, even if he couldn't express it in words. And that's why I jumped at the offer to join the Thalia Theater troupe where he, the great {{< var kessler-full >}}, was one of the managers. {{< var schwartz-full >}} was also hired with me. Together, my wife^[who apparently they also hired!] and I were paid a total of $220/week. I don't know how much they paid {{< var schwartz >}}...

While working out my contract, an amusing scene took place, and I have to tell you about it. I was in a restaurant on 2nd Avenue with {{< var wilner-full >}} on one side, and with {{< var c-weinb >}} - the son of the old Yiddish actor {{< var weinb-full >}} who became a farmer^[and [bought {{< var sam >}}'s farm](./11_1946-10-24.qmd) in ~1895] and wanted his son Charlie to also be a farmer. Charlie didn't want to be a farmer, but a lawyer, and he was usually involved in contract negotiation between actors and theater managers. He had a good sense of humor, and everyone always had good jokes to tell about their time with him, but no one told better jokes than {{< var c-weinb >}} himself.

So, the three of us were sitting around haggling. Not only about the price, how much my wife and I would get paid a week, but also about how they would advertise me and how big my picture would be on the placards. All the kinds of things which are very important to actors... And every time {{< var wilner >}} tossed the cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other and said a few carefully considered words, I nudged Charlie with my foot under the table, to tell him to speak up for me and fight for a better deal.

It went on like this the whole time, but I didn't know that, just as I was kicking Charlie, so was {{< var wilner >}} - he was also kicking Charlie under the table...

And suddenly {{< var c-weinb >}}, with a wide smile on his face, said to both me and {{< var wilner >}}:

-- Now listen here, when you both stop kicking me under the table, I'll know that everyone got what they wanted in the deal and both parties are satisfied... Take your feet off of me because when you kick me I can't think straight...!

We all laughed at this, and afterwards {{< var c-weinb >}} himself told everyone in the theater circles about it, and they were all in stitches laughing about it.

The plan that {{< var wilner >}} made for kicking off the new season in the Thialia Theater was totally shot, because {{< var adler >}} beat us to the punch - he bought the Thalia Theater and became the new manager. Because of this, {{< var kessler >}} was suddenly left without a theater in New York - apparently just as {{< var adler >}} wanted. But {{< var wilner >}} found a solution about what to do with the whole troupe he had hired. He split the troupe in two and rented out the Lyric Theater in Brooklyn and the Liberty Theater in Brownsville, and we started the season with {{< var lateiner-full >}}'s piece {{< var wedding-day >}}^[Listen to [a song from the play](https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/AX3TMJFTUV72UX8Y)].

All at once we were playing in both theaters - in the Lyric Theater {{< var kessler-full >}} played the lead role in the play, and in the Liberty Theater {{< var juvelier-full >}} played the same lead role, and when needed, half of the troupe would go tour the provinces with {{< var kessler >}}. This was in the 1910^[1910/1911] season, and I will never forget those times because, playing with {{< var kessler >}}, I had a lot of good times and also a lot of bad times. But I have forgotten the bad times and remembered only the good times...<br><br>
No matter how hard it was to put up with {{< var kessler >}}'s caprices, it was worth it because he was one of the greatest actors who has ever appeared on our Yiddish stage. With his keen artistic sense, he was able to grasp things that no one else could. He had a world of imagination, but he lacked the right words to express it when speaking. Only through his acting, even without words, he could show how a role should be played, and it was a pleasure to watch him demonstrate in rehearsals how to play one role or another because in his imagination he was able to see it all so clearly. And even if he didn't exactly understand his own role, he found a way through the unknown to create such a full character that you'd never forget.

It was perhaps {{< var kessler >}}'s great misfortune that his heyday on the Yiddish stage was in those days just when long monologues were the main thing. He wasn't so good at those, because he was much more of a physical actor. His acting was more powerful without words than with, and on top of that he was far too impatient to memorize the sea of words in long monologues.

In the rehearsals he held with actors when preparing for a new piece, or even an old one, he used to tell such stories that it was no wonder that everyone would talk about them after. I remember one time in the Lyric Theater when we were rehearsing one of {{< var gorky >}}'s plays, he suddenly, is his own special way, launched into a whole discourse:

-- What is a play? - He posed a question and soon answered it himself. - A play is...is - words! And what are the words that one performs in a play? The words are seeds which the actors gather up from the ground... Just like birds and doves peck at seeds... The seeds roll around on the ground, and you have to peck at them with your beaks and get a taste for them...Understand?

And with that, he finished the speech about the seeds. And when {{< var kessler >}} was not pleased with how an actor was playing a role in rehearsals, he'd usually grumble his famous "No," which made everyone very nervous, and then he'd say:

-- What do I want from you, eh? I want you to peck at the seeds...Like this: With your beak, just like a bird, pick up a seed and give it to me... You see!?... Just like that!...

And he would show the actor how to peck at the seed...

Also, when he himself would be in the middle of a performance on the stage, he would sometimes stand there saying nothing, because he really didn't know the role, and between his teeth he would growl at the prompter:

-- {{< var Gazlen >}}^[Slang effectively meaning "jerk." Literally means thief/bandit]! {{< var Mumzer >}}^[bastard]! Give me a seed...

It was often difficult to perform with him. Difficult and yet pleasant, because he was such a great artist that he could get away with his caprices...
