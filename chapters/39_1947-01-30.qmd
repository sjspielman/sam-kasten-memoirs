> In two roles in a benefit performance for {{< var mogu >}}. -- How {{< var mogu >}} ruled the stage and how his wife ruled over him at home.

Going around like a beggar without consistent work was, to me, always the hardest thing in the world. Even when I was sure that it wouldn't last long and some theater would hire me again, I felt like an outcast and it was deeply unpleasant to have nothing at all to do. I was always like this since when I was young, and my story of 77 years^[In January 1947 when this article was published, he would have been 77 years old, soon to be 78 in April] has not yet fallen heavily on my narrow shoulders. In thinking back on my life, I am not {{< var sam-full >}}, the comedian who made a name for himself on the Yiddish stage, but {{< var shmuelik-full >}}, the {{< var possessor >}}'s little son, who always loved to frolic and make mischief.

And I confess, that even now, there are moments where I forget who I am, and I feel like I am still that little boy {{< var shmuelik-full >}}, and I'm only playing the role of a man named {{< var sam-full >}} who is already, {{< var baruch-hashem >}}, a Jew of 77 years...

Of all the roles which I have played on the Yiddish stage, I was given yet another role still - to play none other than a director^[or, producer]....

But let's circle back to the Novelty Theater, where I performed when {{< var jacob-adler >}} and {{< var boris >}} were on bad terms with their wives. When the Novelty Theater closed before the season was over, I felt like a spare, and I became uneasy and restless - I was never able to sit still, neither at home nor in the cafe where the actors usually got together in their free time.

You must understand that, not having any work when other actors did is, for an actor, one of the worst things. {{< var Nu >}}, as usual, I went back to Philadelphia where my friend {{< var shor-full >}} saw to it that I would, from time to time, play a performance and get my share of applause which I always longed for so much when I was out of work. And when I had nothing to do in Philadelphia, I came back to New York. And so I ran back and forth from one city to the other, never getting any rest. Which is to say - other actors were playing, but I was not! 

And believe me, the notion of a getting paid to perform interested me less than performing itself.

Around that time, {{< var mogu >}} appeared in {{< var lateiner-full >}}'s famous play called {{< var greenhorns >}}. This performance was a benefit concert for the great artist, who was in such a state^[extremely ill] that benefit concerts were his only source of income. And when he asked me if I would play the role of the "little merry negro"^[לוסטיק נעגערעל], who sings and dances and brings joy to everyone, in the performance, I assured him that he could count on me, and when they called me in for rehearsals, I would be there.<br><br>
No actor turned down an offer to play in a benefit performance for {{< var mogu >}}. Even {{< var boris >}} didn't turn it down, and it soon enough it was decided that he, {{< var thomash >}}, would play the role of the fellow called {{< var joe >}}^[מאָנקי–דזשאָו]. This is what he promised {{< var mogu >}}, and the great comedian^[{{< var mogu >}}] was very pleased because he thought {{< var thomash >}} was very well suited for the role of {{< var joe >}}.

{{< var mogu >}} did not take any pleasure asking actors to perform in his benefit performance. He was always afraid that they would turn him down, and for him this would of course be a great offense, and he would be completely mortified. Indeed, this is why his wife {{< var molly >}}^[short for [Amalia](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/mogulesko-amalia.htm)] took on this task on his behalf and kept his involvement to an absolute minimum.

Generally speaking, the great artist {{< var mogu >}} was under his wife {{< var molly >}}'s control. He treated whatever she said as law. And he always listened to her, like a good little obedient boy. And he gave her every penny of his earnings to put away. Whenever he had to buy something for himself, he had to go to her and ask for money. She counted every cent and kept track of all the money he spent. She was a very stingy, the wife of the great Yiddish comedian who he ruled over the hearts and souls of hundreds of thousands of people. She never spent one extra cent, and he had to give her an exact account of every penny he spent. 

It's possible that she was so frugal because she was always afraid that, any any moment, her husband's illness would render him unable able to perform and they would have nothing left to live on, and they would have to go to others for help. She was simply taking precautions so that, if they fell on even harder times, they would not starve to death. This was the situation in which the best Yiddish character-comedian, the God-blessed artist {{< var mogu >}}, found himself, after all those years playing on the Yiddish stage and bringing such joy to the hearts of thousands and thousands of Jews across the whole world.

{{< var Nu >}}, I remember one time when I went to the theater cafe on 2nd Avenue^[He is referring, almost certainly, to [Cafe Royal](https://www.villagepreservation.org/2011/03/01/cafe-royal/)], I spotted {{< var mogu >}} sitting with his wife, and beside them sat the Yiddish journalist Itzhik Gonikman. {{< var molly >}} was visibly upset, and Itzhik Gonikman tried to calm her down, but it was no use.

{{< var mogu >}} himself didn't say a word. He was just sitting there, preoccupied and silent. But as soon as he saw me, he started to speak:

-- You hear, Kestin - he said to me, - I too am a victim of {{< var thomash >}}'s love affair...

At first I didn't understand what he meant - I couldn't fathom how he could also be a victim of {{< var thomash >}}'s affair with the young prima donna {{< var regina >}}. But soon it all became clear. Indeed, {{< var mogu >}} said again:

-- Imagine this - he said - I was sure that {{< var thomash >}} would of course keep his word and he would play the role of {{< var joe >}} in my benefit performance just like he promised. But he screwed me - he ran off somewhere with {{< var regina >}} and no one has any idea where they are... Oy, romance, romance...! - he wailed.

He then become very despondent, and he had no earthly clue what to do about it. 

-- How can we put on the show without him? What will I do? How am I going to get someone else to play {{< var joe >}} on such short notice? 

{{< var mogu >}} was always got like this when he something happened that he did not expect - he become completely helpless and didn't know how to get out of the situation. 

When I heard what was happening, I reassured him:

-- Don't worry, {{< var mogu >}}, - I said to him. - Your benefit performance will still be able to go on without {{< var thomash >}}. _I_ will play the role of {{< var joe >}}, and you can be sure that even though {{< var thomash >}} won't be in the show, you will still do well at the box office. The audiences don't come to see {{< var thomash >}} - they come to see you...

I made the last remark mostly to reassure {{< var molly >}} because she, generally speaking, took a great deal of interest in the box office. She was really pleased that I was prepared to "rescue the situation." {{< var mogu >}} was also very pleased, but he wanted to know what we'd do about the role of the "little merry negro."

-- And who will play the little negro? - he asked.

-- What do you mean who? - I answered. - Also me! Who else if not me?

-- But how will you be able to play both roles? - he asked, shrugging his shoulders. - It will be difficult.

I know it was going to be very hard without him telling me also, but my desire to help {{< var mogu >}} and take away his worries was so great that nothing could talk me out of it. And indeed, right there on the spot, I showed him how, in the prologue during the scene changes, I would be able to play the role of the "little merry negro" and immediately after do a quick change into the role of {{< var joe >}} - the role {{< var thomash >}} was supposed to play.

Like every one of {{< var mogu >}}'s benefit performances, this one too ended up being a great success. And when we all met up afterwards in the restaurant, {{< var mogu >}} thanked me profusely^[This is actually meant to be an idiom that I could not translate: האלטן זילך לעבן מיך], and he said that he wanted everyone to know that I had saved him and he would never forget it. 

I was truly delighted that I was able to do such a {{< var toive >}} for {{< var mogu >}}. And when he told me that it would be his pleasure to return the {{< var toive >}} somehow, I immediately thought of something he could do for me:

-- If so, - I said - I do have a request of you.

-- What request? - {{< var mogu >}} asked. - Don't be shy at all, tell me. You can be sure that I will not let you down.

My request was this - after {{< var pesach >}}, the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia would be holding a benefit performance for me^[{{< var mogu >}}'s benefit performance was on April 15th, 1913, and {{< var pesach >}} that year was April 21-29th. So, {{< var sam >}}'s benefit performance in Philadelphia is likely in early May 1913.]. This had already all been set up with {{< var shor-full >}}. I wondered if he might come there and put on {{< var lateiner >}}'s {{< var greenhorns >}} for it. 

-- This would really be a huge {{< var toive >}} for me. - I told him. - You would really save me too, because, as you know, I've had a really bad season this year.

{{< var mogu >}} didn't even need to think about it. He immediately answered:

-- {{< var Nu >}}, of course I will come and play! I wouldn't be worth my weight in gold^[Again another tricky idiom was here, so I added this instead] if I told you no...

In that moment, I realized that {{< var molly >}} was cringing and was really displeased that he promised right there on the spot to come to Philadelphia to play in my benefit performance. {{< var mogu >}} noticed his wife cringing as well and that she was very unhappy. And because of this, he actually mentioned that I had actually played in many of his benefit performances already. Speaking with a compassionate expression on his face, he looked at his wife as if to say that this time she would support him and not say no when he said yes. And since {{< var molly >}} said nothing at all, he took it upon himself and laid his hands on my shoulders and said:

-- I will come, I will come!...

There are no words to describe the silent scene that then took place between {{< var mogu >}} and {{< var molly >}}. You had to see it with your own eyes. It's not possible to describe. {{< var molly >}}'s gaze reflected both her anger at me, and at the same time also her pity for her husband. And when she realized there was nothing she could do about it, she simply said:

-- He is such a sick man, so very sick... He needs to be taken care of, taken care of very well...

In that moment, I began to understand her. And I pitied them both - both {{< var mogu >}} and his wife. 

And now we are coming to the last moments of my acquaintanceship with {{< var mogu >}}. But I'll save this for the next article.
