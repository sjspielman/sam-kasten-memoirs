# Preface {.unnumbered}

As were many other well-known actors and actresses in the American Yiddish theater, my great-great-grandfather [ּSam Kasten's](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten/about-sam.html)[^kestin] (1869-1953ּ) memoirs were published as serialized articles in American Yiddish press. From September 1946 - February 1947, Sam's memoirs, likely ghost written by [Mendel Osherowitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendel_Osherowitch)[^source], were published as a 45-article series in the [{{< var forverts >}}](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw) (now [*The Forward*](https://forward.com)).

This website contains my translation of his memoirs.
Armed with beginner Yiddish skills and an English/Yiddish dictionary, I provide a mostly verbatim translation, but in certain areas I do shift towards a more natural translation rephrased for the English ear. I indicate areas where I am very unsure of my translation. Translations of many of the lyrics that Sam recounts are still a work in progress, and I am also slowly working to clean up the translation as a whole.^[Want to help? Please reach out at `stephanie.spielman <at> gmail <dot> com`!] I further wrote all chapter titles and added section dividers; these were not part of the original memoirs.


Where possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. I obtained all memoirs articles from [The National Library of Israel](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw) and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the [New York Public Library's](https://www.nypl.org/) microfiche archives.
Links to the online newspaper edition where the article originally appeared are provided when available.

There are also three appendices:

- [Appendix A](./appendices/timeline.qmd): A timeline of Sam's whereabouts over the course of his memoirs
- [Appendix B](./appendices/plays.qmd): A table of all plays Sam describes in his memoirs, including the English translations of their names
- [Appendix C](./appendices/people.qmd): A list (with biography links, where available) of all people Sam meets and describes in his memoirs

Yiddish words are generally defined on their first usage. I hope to add a Yiddish glossary in the future!


### Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Many thanks to librarians at [NYPL's Dorot Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/jewish-division) for support finding the "missing" articles!
Thanks also to Steve Lasky and other volunteers who have contributed to the *Museum of the Family History* for making many translations from [Zalmen Zylbercweig's {{< var leks >}}](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex-biography.htm) available! They have been invaluable for cross-referencing.

This project is dedicated to the memory of my maternal grandfather Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who, as one of my paternal great-great-grandfathers, is entirely unrelated to Sol) and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings.
Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, {{< var beshert >}}.


[^kestin]: 
    Note that Sam's name was written in Yiddish as Sam "_Kestin_" (סעם קעסטין), but I will write his name throughout as {{< var sam-full >}}.
