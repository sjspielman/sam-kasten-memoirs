    "text": "Preface\nAs were many other well-known actors and actresses in the American Yiddish theater, my great-great-grandfather ּSam Kasten’s1 (1869-1953ּ) memoirs were published as serialized articles in American Yiddish press. From September 1946 - February 1947, Sam’s memoirs, likely ghost written by Mendel Osherowitch2, were published as a 45-article series in the Forverts (now The Forward).\nThis website contains my translation of his memoirs. Armed with beginner Yiddish skills and an English/Yiddish dictionary, I provide a mostly verbatim translation, but in certain areas I do shift towards a more natural translation rephrased for the English ear. I indicate areas where I am very unsure of my translation. Translations of many of the lyrics that Sam recounts are still a work in progress, and I am also slowly working to clean up the translation as a whole.3 I further wrote all chapter titles and added section dividers; these were not part of the original memoirs.\nWhere possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images. I obtained all memoirs articles from The National Library of Israel and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the New York Public Library’s microfiche archives. Links to the online newspaper edition where the article originally appeared are provided when available.\nThere are also three appendices:\nYiddish words are generally defined on their first usage. I hope to add a Yiddish glossary in the future!",

    "section": "",
    "text": "First of all, I would like to make a brief introduction. When I try to describe what I went through during over 50 years in the American Yiddish theater, as well as things I heard and saw over those years, I feel just as if I were back there now, for the very first time - dressed in “vinegar and honey”1, released alone on a big stage in a huge theater, with the eyes of thousands and thousands of people turned to me; Everyone is waiting, waiting to hear me say something, but I’m standing up there in a panic, completely confused and without any idea where to begin…\nWell, really, what do I start with and what do I leave for later? 50 years on stage is no small thing!\n50 years of acting!\n50 years of singing!\n50 years of dancing!\nFor over half a century, years gone and never to return, I knew the greatest and most famous Yiddish actors, the pioneers, the builders and founders of the Yiddish theater in America; I was close friends with most of them, and I have stories about all of them, though I can’t tell them all.\nWhere do I begin?\nAnd suddenly so many events and moments that I had long forgotten spring to mind. I suddenly remember things I have not thought of for years. The images of people I was once very close with and who have now passed on float before my eyes. And when you say their names and talk about the roles they created on the Yiddish stage when at their peak, you shake your head and realize that when they were alive, they were not appreciated enough. But if they were alive now, people would know how to appreciate them…\nAnd the more I immerse myself in my memory, the more I realize that everything is gone, gone… Away in the distant past, gradually forgotten more and more.\nEven for me, the funny comedian on the Yiddish stage, thinking about this weighs heavily on my heart, and I don’t know where to begin.\nIt’s a long way back…but still! When you think about the long road you traveled, you think of not only those you met along the way, but also your own journey, and it seems that everything was just yesterday… That’s why I will start with myself, and as I continue, I’ll bring many others into the story. I believe my stories will reflect a piece of history of 50 years of Yiddish theater in America. I am sure that the thousands and thousands of Jews who are interested in Jewish life of the past and present will find this interesting.\nSo, I will start with myself, as one usually does in a memoir. Right away I want to say, not unlike many other Jews that came to America from Russia and from many other countries, I didn’t keep my name when I came America; My name was not Sam Kasten back home, but Shmuel’ik Konstantinovsky. That’s the name they gave me, and that’s what everyone called me. And no one, God forbid, ever thought about how much time it took to say such a long name…\nI don’t know what city I was born in. And don’t think that this is some joke on my part, a prank by a comedian who sometimes pulls them on the stage. All my years I tried to find out what city, or what town, I was born in, but all my efforts were in vain and I couldn’t figure it out. You see, there were two versions to the story: One version says was that I was born in Kyiv, in the current capital of Ukraine, when my mother was in Kyiv visiting very close relative of ours who lived in Solomenka2. More than once I heard my mother and father talk about this. I was very satisfied to have been born in such a big city as Kyiv… To be born out in the world, in a big beautiful city, and not some kind of wasteland shtetl nobody has heard of or knows where it is…\nBut, as if to spite me, as though it was not beshert3 for me to take pride in this, there was a second version of where I was born - not in the big city of Kyiv, but in the small village of Zatishiye, which is located between the two cities of Belaya Tserkov4 and Vasilkov5, in the Kyiv Governorate.\nI’m not sure which version is true. We have this whole issue with us…the family is so confused, it was impossible to figure it out. One thing I am sure of, however, is that I was indeed born.\nThe best thing about it is that I am alive and that for 50 years, I have been acting and singing and dancing on the Yiddish stage in America. I also know that now I am already, boruch hashem, 77 years old, which means I was born in 1869, when Alexander the 2nd was still sitting on the throne of Russia.\nThis was exactly eight years after panshina6 was abolished in Russia and we were living in a shtetl. I still remember those Ukrainian farmers well, along with their stories about the times during panshina when the landowners could do what they wanted with the serfs.\nIn the village of Zatishiye, where we lived for a long time, my tate7, Leyb Sender, had a farm, and that is why they called him Leyb Sender the Possessor8, and my mame9 was called Feige the Possessorka. When he was home, he did business with the landowner, Graf10 Branitsky, who was the owner of the whole village and had a large fortune.\nTate was a constant presence in the landowner’s court. I still remember how every time he went to court, he combed his beautiful beard in a very special way into two points, and when he came back, but he told stories about the nobles’ strange whims that he could not understand. And all the usual stories ended with my father shrugging and saying, “That guy’s nuts!”\nAnd by this he meant, what else is there say - we’re living in his world, not ours…\nHe was a very frum11 Jew, my tate. He carefully preserved Judaism with all the details and rules, and he shunned transgressions, just as one shuns fire. He also wanted his children to be frum and devout. There were six of us children at home, two sons and four daughters, and tate was afraid that we would become, cholileh12, goyishe because of the village. He ensured that we always, summer and winter, kept a melamed13 in the house for us to study with - not only with the boys, but also with the girls.\nHe also made sure that on Shabbes14 or a yontif15 we would not be in the village. In the village, he said, a Jew cannot observe Shabbes and yontif. And that’s why we all used to go to a Jewish hostel in the city on Shabbes and yontif kept with such meticulous kashrus16 that even the rebbe himself would eat there.\nAfter praying, he would always get joy from bringing some poor guests from the shul to the hostel, and they would eat there at his expense. And mame enjoyed it greatly; She was very pleased that tate behaved in such a godly manner. And when she was well-rested, she used to say to him, with a loving smile in her eyes, “Leyb Sender, mirtzeshem17, you will live to 120 and you will enter genaydn18 right away…”\nSometimes he replied, “Nu, what else are we living for?”\nAnd at home, my father always behaved like a true frummer19, and he did everything he could so that we, the children in the house, would follow his ways. But living in the village had such an effect on us that it was hard to walk always on the road that our father had led us on. The stillness of the nature around us attracted me like a magnet, and when I could, I quietly slipped away from the melamed and went outside and ran away. I crossed the dusty village roads and went to the wide fields that stretched far away, where heaven and earth meet, and I played with the goyishe children and felt free, just like the birds that fly away.\nI snuck out very slyly and quietly so that the melamed wouldn’t notice. I was so quick that even before people looked around for me, I was already so far away that they couldn’t see me. I already had my own roads to run and my own places to play. I wasn’t afraid of getting in trouble, because I was an overprotected child; My parents had always given me a lot, they have loved and pampered me. And I was always sure that they would not punish me. I don’t know why I was praised so much. It could be that it was because I was such a little thing, a little elf, who looked so pitiful that so nobody had the heart to treat me too harshly. But no matter what - I was blessed that I could do what I wanted, and I always avoided punishment…\nMore than anything else in the village, I loved to watch the young Ukrainian peasants dance. I loved watching them dance to the beat of a harmonica, whose tune that lured everyone to come join in was simply a pleasure to see. More than once in the village I followed them to the Ukrainian chapel, where they played at a goyishe wedding. I could not take my eyes off the dancers, who hopped around so much that the ground shook under their feet. And when I came home afterwards, I would dance just like they did all day long.\nOne time when tate saw me dancing, he shrugged his shoulders, and taking both tips of his beard in his hand, he said, “Just look, just look at the little Shmuel’ikel of ours dance!… What’s the big deal with you? What are you jumping around so much for?\nI was very ashamed then. What got into me, skipping around like that? But as soon as tate I got back up and danced again: 20…\nLife was good for me. I was happy…",

    "text": "And on the other hand if, cholileh, business went poorly and we suffered from the landowner’s capriciousness, of course then he had to go to the rebbe, pour out his bitter heart to him, and beg for him to give his blessing and pray that God will help. When a family member fell ill, before anything else tate would go to the rebbe and ask him to grant refue shlema5. Everything was connected to belief in God and in the holy rebbe, even the nigunim that we used to sing at home, during a simche6, or anytime at all that you had joy in your heart…\nIn his enthusiasm for the Makarover rebbe, it wasn’t enough for tate to just to him from time to time. He also brought the rebbe to our home a few times a year. These visits brought great joy, and the local Jewish farmers from all the surrounding shtetlech7 came to us in Zatishiye and they shed their village pride. During shala shudis8, people swallowed, enraptured, every word the rebbe uttered in his dvar toire9 about the parshe10 of the week.\nAs enthusiastic as tate was about the Makarover rebbe tzaddik11, you can imagine how it went whenever the rebbe came to visit us in Zatishiye. When tate heard that the rebbe had been spotted in his rickshaw at the village gate, he went out to meet him with a song. While singing, he unharnessed the horse from the rickshaw, and taking the reins with both hands, he himself led the great rebbe to our home. You could see on his face how much pleasure this gave him, and he considered it such a great mitzvah that he would not give it up for all the treasures in the world.\nTo this day, I can still picture tate so clearly pulling the rebbe’s rickshaw while his face shines with joy. I also remember what the joy in general in our house when tate came home with the Makarover rebbe; The Jewish farmers of the neighboring villages, all simple healthy and strong Jews, but ardently chasidic and very pious, were suddenly very different people. It was none other than the ruach-hakoydesh12 coming over them. Just as if a miracle had happened, all of a sudden their arrogance left them and they entered into such a spiritual nobility never before seen.\nThey sang with such fervor that it was a pleasure to listen to them, and they danced with such exuberance as if they were floating in the air… Among the chasidim, I saw for the first time in my life how Jews danced. And I liked it so much that I went and danced with them… I was still a little boy then, and during the dance I tripped on my feet. I was always trying to grab a hold of the tails of someone’s kaftanas I skipped together with the chasidim who were so delighted the rebbe was there. When tate saw how I danced and caught on to the chasidic movements and the nigunim, he really kvelled over it and pinched me on the cheek, saying “Well done, Shmuel’ikel. Well done.”\nThe other chasidim also kvelled that I, a little boy, small as an elf, joined in the round and so quickly picked up their style of dancing. One of them, a gabe of the Makarover rebbe, a redheaded man with a beautiful beard and two long plump hands, said to my father afterwards, “Just look, just look, Leyb Sender! He is truly something unusual and delightful, the little one! … Nu, may God help, that he will be dedicated to the Toire, to the chupe, and to maysim toivm13… He is growing, isn’t he… He is a growing vessel…”\nIn my love for dancing, I went back and forth between both Jewish and goyishe dance. It didn’t make any difference to me - as long as I was dancing. It was enough for me to just hear some nign, and I would immediately start dancing to it. Even just walking around I did in a dancing sort of way. And to this day, I don’t understand what I was so joyful for, what put me in such high spirits, that from the start I danced with such gusto…\nBut there came a time when I stopped dancing and could not be as happy as I was - when tate suddenly started to complain about his health. “I’m sick, Feige,” he would often say to mame. “I’m very sick… and somehow my heart tells me that it’s not good. Really not good…” He went to the rebbe several times who wished him a refue shlema, but it didn’t help. Still, tate complained, “I am sick, Feige. Very sick.”\nNo matter how small I was, I still felt and understood that his complaints about his poor health meant a difficult time was falling upon us, and it made me melancholy. When I would forget about it, as children do, I would start to sing some kind of nign, sometimes a Yiddish one and sometimes a goyishe one, and I’d begin to dance along. But mame would scold me, “Shame on you, Shmuel’ikel. You should be ashamed of yourself! Tate is sick and you are acting joyfully…”\nOur whole house became a different place when tate fell ill. And there was nothing we could do for his illness, because there was no doctor in the village, no medical practitioner, and not even a pharmacy. No matter how much we begged tate to see a doctor in Vasilkov, or in Belaya Tserkov, he would not go. We could not prevail upon him at all, and he had the same answer to everything: “What can a doctor help me with? How long I am destined to live in the world, to be alive… The doctor will not give me more years to live; A man is in God’s hands…”\nWith great difficulty, we finally managed to convince him to let us bring a doctor from Vasilyvshchyne, an absent-minded Jew who had some kind of panacea for all diseases in the world. The doctor from Vasilyvshchyne gave tate a tincture, and told him that if things didn’t get better to call him again…\nAt that time, my oldest sister Bas-Sheyva became a bride, and it is worth telling the story of how the shidduch14 was made, because it’s very typical of the Jewish life in those days.\nAmong the chasidim that my tate often met at the Makarover rebbe’s court, there was a man named Pinya Radetsky. Radetsky, a Jewish landowner, lived in the town of Rybinka15, which is not far from Vasilyvshchyne, and just like my father, he was also an ardent chasid, a zealot, and he often went to the Makarover rebbe’s. As it usually happens, at the rejoicings at the rebbe’s court, people often drank l’chaim16 and wished for salvation for the Jews. And once, when my father was drinking l’chaim with Pinya Radetsky, they talked for a while about this and that, whatever came to mind. Each time, someone else poured a glass of whiskey and, as usual, an “order” started:\n– L’chaim! May God will it so!\n– L’chaim toivm u’sholem! God bless you, and so it will be!\nSo, little by little, they drank another glass and another glass, and showered each other with blessings and wishes. During their conversation, my tate told Pinya that his wife was pregnant and he hoped that, boruch hashem, the birth passes peacefully. And when Pinya heard this, he got excited and told tate that his wife was also preparing to give birth. Soon, in the blink of an eye, it was already agreed between the two Makarover chasidim that if one’s wife gave birth to a boy and the other’s wife to a girl, they would make a shidduch.\nThey shook hands and made a tekiyat-kaf17. The deal was done.\nA short time after that, my mother gave birth to a girl named Bas-Sheyva. Pinya Radetsky’s wife also gave birth to a boy, and he was named Aron18. And so, as agreed in the tekiyat-kaf, this shidduch was beshert and this marriage was m’hashamayim19.\nAnd so, my sister Bas-Sheyva, the oldest of all the children in our family, was already a bride the moment she was born. And that’s how she was really treated even when she was still a very little girl, already “Bas-Sheyva, the bride.” Tate loved Bas-Sheyva very much and showed her a lot of tenderness, not only when she was still little but when also as she grew. All the while, he was looking forward to the time when she would go to the chupe20.\nThey had decided to have Bas-Sheyva’s wedding on the Shabbes after Shavu’es21, but tate’s health was already so poor that it was no wonder that he couldn’t think about anything other than whether he would live to see his first daughter’s wedding… You could tell because he suddenly started working to move the date up from the Shabbes after Shavu’es to two weeks before Pesach22…\n“I want to be at my oldest daughter’s wedding,” he said. “I want to take her to the chupe…” Apparently, he knew in his heart that he would not live for long. He felt it. Everyone in the family felt it. So we decided not to move my sister’s wedding up to two weeks before Pesach, as my father wished…\nMy parents began to prepare for the great simche when, with God’s help, they would lead to the couple who were blessed with a tekiyat-kaf before they were born to the chupe. And while preparing for the wedding, we were also preparing for a funeral…\nYou had to prepare for it, even when you didn’t want to, because tate was already so sick that it was clear he would not live much longer. He himself knew this more than anyone else. And that’s why tate often repeated the only thing that made sense to him at the time, “I want to at my oldest daughter’s wedding… I want to lead Bas-Sheyva to the chupe and I beg God, give me strength so that I may see before my death that my family honors the tekiyat-kaf…”\nHe counted the days that remained until two weeks before Pesach. He looked forward to the very hour…\nI also counted the days left until the wedding. But I did not understand the silent tragedy that was taking place there. I was still too young to understand it all. I just wanted dance at the first wedding in our family…",

    "text": "Tate did everything he could so no one would focus on how gravely ill he was. A few times a day, he would get out of bed and wander around the house, with a cane, and touch and look at everything we had bought for Bas-Sheyva and prepared for the wedding. When the inlaws arrived, he also thought that we shouldn’t forget about our poorer relatives who lived in the nearby shtetlech. Every time he remembered one poor relative or another, he would say, “For God’s sake, don’t forget them too!” He would also say that there should be as many poor people as possible at the wedding feast.\n“Don’t spare a dime, Feige,” he would said to mame, who, even more than he did, really made an effort to hide the heavy thoughts she was carrying because of his illness. “Don’t spare a dime!… It costs so much already, we can pay a little more… God is our father and he will not abandon us…”\nMame did everything that tate told her. But once it became clear to her that he was walking around the house with his cane too much, she beseeched him, “Follow me, Leyb Sender, and lie down. You are already tired and you need to rest. And believe me,” she continued leading him to his secluded alcove to rest, “believe me that at our daughter Bas-Sheyva’s wedding, mirtzeshem, we won’t want for a single thing. It will be good for God and man alike…”\nAnd so it was.\nAt the wedding, which took place two weeks before Pesach in the little village of Zatishiye between Vasilkov and Belaya Tserkov, so much family came that even at a fair you never saw so many people. There wasn’t a single Jewish landowner in all the nearby shtetlech and towns who didn’t come to the wedding. Among the landowners, all Jews with a broad hand and a lot of power and strength, there were also chasidim of the Makarover rebbe. My tate wouldn’t invite any other chasidim1. He would certainly not have them at the doorstep of his house. And the Jewish landowners did not come alone, but with their wives and children, and they drove to the village in horse-drawn carriages. Just as they felt at home among the Jews, so too they felt at home among the goyim, and they spoke the goyishe language Ukrainian just as freely and easily as they spoke Yiddish.\nBut all the landowners and family from the shtetlech who came to the wedding made way for Abba the klezmer musician with his band of musicians, who were brought down from Belaya Tserkov. Abba the klezmer musician was a smart, cunning Jew who even then, even in those times, wore a pressed shirt and a refined, short little kaftan that fell right to his waist. He wasn’t born yesterday, and he knew how to perform for high-ranking courtiers, for whom a “kerbel is a mumzer”2.\nThe greatest wears brought for my sister Bas-Sheyva’s wedding were from the rich farmer Eliezer Shmuel, who had a reputation for being a very wealthy, powerful man with a generous hand. Abba and his muscians performed for him some kind of “vivetsh” and some kind of “dobrivetsh” , over which Eliezer Shmuel was truly beside himself with joy, and he said that he had never heard anything like it before…\nThe simche was great. The wedding turned the whole village of Zatishiye upside-down. Our goyishe neighbors, simple peasants, felt just like family and came to the wedding. They brought gifts and danced and offered their best wishes to the groom and the bride, that they may be blessed with good fortune and never know bad times… In those days, Jews and goyim still lived together in peacefully in the villages… The goyim began to show hatred towards the Jews only later, when they were persuaded that the alone Jews were to blame for all the troubles that befell them…\nBut no matter how great the simche at the wedding was with Jews and goyim celebrating together in the village, the joy was still overshadowed. And how could it not be, because the whole time tate was so ill and so weak. Everytime he sat at the table, cane in hand, to watch everyone dancing and rejoicing, he would soon turn his head away, his face would grow pale, and he’d have to be taken back home to rest in bed for a little while.\nMame usually was the one to take him home. She was always the first to notice how pale his face became when he sat down. He didn’t resist when she led him back to rest. Leaning on his cane with a strange smile on his sallow face, he walked with a sense of submission. He no longer had even a trace of strength, of the possessor’s authority and confidence he had before he got sick.\nWalking like this with mame, he comforted and reassured her, “It’s not over, Feige, it’s not over… Soon I will come back out to celebrate again… It’s not over! Let the music play on! Let us dance! Let us be happy!”\nAs far as he could, he gathered all his strength, and with mame he led his daughter to the chupe - his very first daughter, whom he had married off before she was even born…\nHis new kaftan hung loosely on him because he was so emaciated and weak. But his face still shone. You could see how joyous and lucky he felt to lead his first child to the chupe. After the ceremony when the dancing began, I watched as he kvelled and clapped his hands, and I was suddenly overcome with such a strong desire to make him happy that I didn’t know what to do. I ran to him, grabbed both his hands, and started kissing them. Tears were falling from my eyes. Tears of joy. Soon I entered the round3 and danced with such joy that my sadness evaporated away, and tate was full of naches4.\n“Dance, Shmuel’ik!”, he encouraged me each time I ran up to him, full of joy, and kissed his hands again. “Dance Shmuel’ik! At a wedding one should dance! At a wedding one should be happy!…”\nAnd four weeks after the wedding he died.\nAfter tate’s death, mame took on the the heavy burden of providing for us. She began running the farm herself, and people started calling her “Feige the Possessorka.” But as she began immersing herself in the business and learning what she hadn’t known before, she soon realized that tate was not at all as well-off as he came across and he had spent much more than they could afford…\nFor two years, mame struggled with the farm, and it was very difficult for her to manage. Without tate’s authority, without his confident air, their possessiye couldn’t go on as it had before. Nothing worked like it did when tate did it. We couldn’t afford all the things we could when he was still alive. Everything was completely different from what it was…\nEven a permanent melamed for the children could not be kept. And I confess, at the time that didn’t bother me so much because I never had a great desire to learn. But now, I regret it very much…\nBut life went on. When mame was exhausted from the miserable possessiye in Zatishiye, she married off my older brother, Itzhik Gedolia5, who was nicknamed “Kotik”6 in the family - he was quiet like a little kitten who’s always playing in the corner. Itzhik Gedolia was married to the daughter7 of a certain Shmuel Pekelis8, a Jewish merchant, who lived in Belaya Tserkov and conducted business with other cities as well.\nMy brother Kotik’s wedding was the first time I saw and heard the badchen Berele Shachnes, who in those days had made a name for himself in Jewish cities and shtetlech in the Kyiv and Podolier Governorates. He was really an artist in his profession, and he acted like he was building a whole whole dynasty9. Everyone knew that he doesn’t perform at weddings all by himself, but along with his son-in-law who helped with the performance to earn his room and board10.\nWhenever the badchen Berele Shachnes performed the Kale Bazetsn11, the women would always shed tears, and this was no exception. After the Kale Bazetsn, he performed a scene that his son-in-law helped with. I still remember the scene they performed during my brother’s wedding after they performed the Kale Bazetsn which made all the women cry.\nIn this scene, Berele with his pointed beard struck such a pose as if to say you could rely on him and you’d soon see something worth every penny. As he was standing like that, his son-in-law came in disguised as a beggar and began singing a very sad nign12:\nHe sang it one time, and then a second time. And then he implored, “Spare a coin!”\nThen Berele Shachnes the badchen lashed out in anger at the poor beggar, and they began a dialogue:\n– Berele: Hey, you cheapskate, why did you come here just to make the wedding guests sad? This is a wedding where everyone is meant to be happy!\n– Beggar: But how can I be happy, when I am a poor Jew begging for money?\n– Berele: You must be happy!\n– Beggar: I must?\n– Berele: Yes, you must!\n– Beggar: Nu, if I must, you have to show me how. Come on, how could a poor Jew like me be happy?!\n– Berele: I’ll show you! Of course, I will show you!\nThen, they sang to each other:\nI really enjoyed it. I gazed open-mouth at the whole performance in awe, and I can say that this was the first time in my life that I had ever seen theater. Yiddish theater. Even to this day, I still think about the badchen Berele Shachnes, the first Yiddish actor I ever saw in my life…",

    "text": "Tate’s death shook our entire family so much that things could never be as they were. No matter how hard mame worked so that we would not be in need or have to ask for help, she could not make it happen. It never happened. And then the name “Feige the Possessorka” began to sound like a joke, because a possessor is a generally a professional who has means to live well.\nWhen mame lost all interest in running the property as tate had, she left the village and settled in the town of Rybinka, where my sister Bas-Sheyva lived with her husband. And there, in Rybinka, we opened what is called a “sustenance-house,”1 where they sell everything that you can think of - even a little drink too. Mame worked very hard in the “general store,” and she was really a great eyshes-chayil2 and knew how to get along with people. Not only with the Jewish customers, who bought various small things from us, but also with the goyishe customers. She understood who could be given a loan, and who could not. And she behaved such that people in the town had a great respect for her, and they still called her “Feige the Possessorka.”\nA possessorka without a possessiye3.\nMame couldn’t figure out what to do with me. She was of course sure that a woman - a widow - could still raise her daughters and, as it were, stay on the right path, such that when people see them, they will see beautiful and well-behaved children. But with a son, it was more difficult. Especially with such a little son, who was a bit over-confident and didn’t show any great desire to learn… Just like tate, mame also wanted me to grow up to be a mentsh and to study, if not a lot, at least a little. And because of that, she took me to Belaya Tserkov, and there she put me in the cheder of the melamed Chaim Machalies because she heard that he was a very good melamed and that the children of the finest and most honorable families learn from him.\n– Look, Shmuel’ik - she announced to me - put your head down to study, you will be a scholar. A Jewish boy must be able to learn.\nWhen we lived in Belaya Tserkov, I lived with Shmuel Pekelis, the father-in-law of my brother Itzhik Gedolia, who was given the nickname Kotik because he was as quiet as a kitten. Shmuel Pekelis himself promised that they would keep me at home like their own child and that nothing would go wrong. And so it was. They kept me at home like their own child and they took good care of me. But the trouble was, because I was an orphan4, I was watched over a little too closely. I just had to do one little thing, and I was immediately reprimanded for it:\n– This is not acceptable, Shmuel’ik. Not acceptable. Your mother is doing everything so you can be in this cheder, and this is how you repay her!\nThe truth was that I was not an ordinary boy. On the contrary, I was actually a quiet boy and I didn’t catch anyone’s eye too much. In addition, I always kept myself very clean and neat, and when someone gave me a new outfit, my eyes really lit up. I preserved it in such a way that it always looked brand new, as if it had come straight off the needle. What’s more - I had a tendency to sing every song that I heard in the street. As soon I heard it and immediately I was singing it. And if the song could be danced to, I danced to it.\nAnd all the people who were so watchful over me did not want me behaving this way, and they scolded me: “What is the big deal with you? And what are you doing, dancing out of nowhere like that?” And sometimes they also brought up that I am an orphan… An orphan must not sing. An orphan should not be happy.\nAlso, my brother Itzhik Gedolia, the silent Kotik, used to come from time to time to Belaya Tserkov from the village of Solovinke, where he sold grain. He also reprimanded me and told me how to behave - so that everyone in the home, including his father-in-law and mother-in-law, would be able to say that I was just as quiet as him. And this, in the end, was too much for me, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I also longed for my mother very much, and so I begged him, my silent brother:\n– Do me a toive5 and take me back home. I’ve been here enough. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’d rather go to the cheder in Rybinka.\nI also asked my mame to let me come home. And when they finally gave in to me and they brought me back to Rybinka and I was once again home with my mame, they sent me to cheder with the melamed Shmuel Yossel, and this alone meant I could not have any joy; nothing good could come of this.\nHe was an angry Jew, Shmuel Yossel. A Jew with a red beard, a broad physique, and with two large, glaring eyes. He did not know how to speak to a student with kindness. He was always angry, and the anger always simmered in him just like in a cauldron. And when his two big eyes, the glaring ones, focused on a student, it felt like “the value of congealed/hardened mother’s milk”6 and the student was overwhelmed with fear.\nThough I wanted to keep the promise I made to my mame that I would study well in the cheder at Rybinka, I was unable to do so. It was absolutely impossible to learn anything from such a melamed. We all hated him in the cheder. His wife, an overburdened woman, who sold apples in the market, also hated him. And her hatred towards him was not for no reason, because there rarely a day went by that he did not beat her. And always, when he hit her, she screamed with a voice as if possessed, “Save me, Jewish children! He is going to kill me, the murderer…!” Of course, I could not learn much Toire from such a melamed. Every day in the cheder was a punishment for me.\nAnd from that time I remember something, which was strongly imprinted in my memory, and I want to tell it here: This was on a hot summer day, soon after lunch. In the shtetl, there was suddenly a stampede. And when the Reb7 went outside to see what was happening there, he immediately ran back inside and shouted at the top of his voice: “Come, shkotsim8, with me!”\nIn a hurry, he grabbed his kaftan and went out quickly, and we all ran after him, wondering where he was taking us - we were afraid. We followed him and none of us said a word the whole time. And so we went until he led us all into the besmedresh9 and there we saw something I will never forget.\nIn the middle of a group of inflamed and very upset Jews stood a frightened man, Meïr the synagogue choirboy, who at that time used to go to a nearby town to pray on Shabbes in front of the pulpit. We knew that he was the son of the Rokinter10 Rabbi, and that the Rybinker butcher, Yehiel, was his brother. He was a very young man, Meïr, and he always behaved as if he had no fear of anyone in the world. This time, however, he stood trembling in fear, and the enraged Jews shouted at him, called him the worst names, and one of them, an angry Jew, slapped him across the face.\n– You scoundrel! You ocher yisroel11!\nBut this was not enough for them, so they also forced him down and lashed him. And it didn’t help to wrestle with them; Meïr could not stand alone against so many people and he had to accept the punishment that was given to him.\nI did not know why the choirboy received such punishment. The other students in Shmuel Yossel’s cheder did not know either. Only when they released him and handed him over to the hands of his brother Yehiel, the butcher of Rybinka, did we find out that he was accused of some very big crime, a sin against God. That’s what they said in the shtetl. They also said that his friend Leibish was also involved in the crime. The Rybinker rabbi’s son had “modernized” and was out for “bad culture”12. Leibish should have been given the same punishment as befell the choirboy, but he ran away and nobody knew where he went.\nAnd meanwhile, the whole town went “upside-down”13. Everywhere people talked about this. And Reb Shmuel Yossel was in “seventh heaven”14 and he did not miss any opportunity to remind the students in the classroom of what they had seen.\n“Nu, shkotsim,” he said, stroking his red beard. “Nu, shkotsim, have you seen what is done to an innocent young man when he commits a sin against God? Ha?… That’s exactly how you will be beaten and cut off, when you commit a sin against God…”\nThis is why he had led all of us to the besmedresh: He wanted us to see it with our own eyes and to remember it…",

    "text": "Considering what happened at that time, you would think I would have remembered something more from when the tsar, Alexander the Second, was killed in Russia. This happened in 1881, when I was already a 12-year-old boy - “approaching 13” as we used to say in Ukraine. But there isn’t a single thing left in my memory about that important event in Russian history. And if I used to know something, I covered it up and I don’t remember it.\nI also remember very little of the pogroms that came after the tsar was killed - the pogroms of 1881 and 1882, when Alexander the Third ascended the throne and Jews started fleeing from Russia wherever their eyes could see because it was no longer safe to stay. I only remember one story from the time we had pogroms, and I will tell it here.\nI remember how one day in Rybinka, we suddenly heard the bells ringing in the church, and that alone was enough to strike fear into the hearts of the Jews. And suddenly, the farmers1 came from all around and started going into the church. Many farmers also came from the village of Solovinke, which was separated from the town by a river. They all started arriving from the other shore and immediately went to the church. And when the Jews of the town saw this, they said that nothing good would come of it, and the mothers began to hide the children. There was such a panic that no one knew what to do first and where to hide.\nAnd the bells of the church kept ringing and ringing and the more they rang, the greater the fear became, and we were certain we would not be able to escape the impending calamity…\nBut it turned out differently; The goyim left the church quiet, calm, and they went home without bothering anyone. Later we found out that the good priest, who was always a close friend of the Jews, saved the village. He heard that the goyim were preparing to stage a pogrom on the Jews of the town, and he promised himself that he would do whatever he could to prevent this; He did not want there to be a pogrom in the town and for Jewish blood to be shed for no reason. Because of that, he called the goyim into the church with the bells, and he gave them a speech that God would punish them severely for such a sin. And this had such an effect on them that they left the church and returned home quiet and calm; They didn’t bother the Jews in the town, and there was no pogrom.\nThe Jews in Rybinka then breathed more freely. They thanked God for the great miracle that happened and they treated the good priest as if he were a tzaddik. But people were not entirely sure whether he would be able to continue protecting the town from a pogrom. We began to hear rumors that so-and-so had left for America, and so-and-so had his eye on leaving for America. And when they talked about it, they didn’t say that they had left for America, but that they had fled to America. You never traveled to or visited America - you escaped to America.\nEvery letter that arrived from America was usually passed around hand to hand, and people talked about the letter as if it was the most important news that happened. In particular, when a picture of someone who had “escaped to America” arrived, people walked around with it as if it was just a great pleasure and they simply couldn’t tear their eyes away from it and everyone gaped:\n– You can’t even recognize them… they have become completely different people in America… you can see that they live there like noblemen…!\nAnd also in our family, people started talking about going to America. The first was my oldest sister, Bas-Sheyva; She was the first to go to America, together with her husband. They settled in Philadelphia. And even though from the letter that they wrote to us from there, it was clear that they weren’t making much money from “dragging the shovel”2, we still started to prepare for the journey. At that time, mame started saying quite openly that she would not stay in Russia - she would take the children and leave with them for America.\nIt was difficult to earn enough money for the household from the general store that mame ran in Rybinka. In general, it was difficult for Jews in Russia when Alexander the Third sat on the throne; what they wanted to do, was not allowed. So many things were forbidden for Jews, and we were at the mercy of the pristav3 and sometimes the sotski4.\nMame continued to act like the kind of person people assumed she was - the successful business owner - and that we wanted for nothing, and she should still be thought of as “Feige the Possessorka.”\nBut there were times when we weren’t able to afford necessities; And we all worked in the “general store” - mame, the three daughters, and me5. There was always something to do in the “general store,” but there was still no income.\nMame always wanted to be able to pay her debts on time and not owe anything to anyone. So we struggled for a couple of years until my sister Bas-Sheyva started writing better letters from America. Then, mame sold the house and everything she could, and she took us, her four children, with her to America. This was, I believe, in the year 1885, and at that time I was already a young man of about 16 years, going on 17. And I was very happy that we were going to America, and I bragged about it to all my friends.\n– You’ll see what will happen! In America, we will become such people, and so it shall be! In America it will be - none of your business!6\nI still didn’t know what I would become in America. I didn’t even have the slightest idea about theater at that time. The only piece of “theater” that floated through my memory from time to time was the comic scene that the badchen Berele Shachnes performed together with his son-in-law at my older brother’s wedding. It seemed to bother me - that if they would have let me, I would have done it even better; It occurred to me then, that when I am older perhaps they will let me do this in America for a wedding, I will show them what I can do and then, in time, I will become a second Berele Shachnes in America…\nI could not have imagined a better entertainer than him, Berele Shachnes, at that time. So it occurred to me that the best thing I could do was follow in his footsteps, and before leaving for America, I often sang the song that I heard him sing:\nIt was good for me; I dreamed of a happy life in America, even before I arrived there. And when another friend asked me why I was so eager to go to America, I had one answer: “What is it that you say? It will be as I told you - none of your business!” And I said this in good fun; I didn’t get angry with anyone.\nWe fled to America just as thousands and thousands of other Jews did; We crossed the border in “blackness”7. That’s what people called it when they snuck to get passports while hiding from the special officers who patrolled the border at night.\nAnd I still remember that when we crossed the border and we arrived at Brod8, we had trouble with our agent, because he didn’t want to let us take our suitcases without more money9. This made mame angry - she said this was murderous and violent. But it didn’t help at all, and we had to give the agent more money.\nIt is impossible to describe the troubles that poor Jewish travelers had at the borders in those years when they “escaped to America.” But it was still better than it is now10; You didn’t have to have a visa, nobody needed a passport, and you could go wherever you wanted…\nOn the way, we waited for a little while in the German city of Bremen, and then we, along with many other Jews, were put on a ship. “Elbe,” I remember, was the name of that ship. We schlepped ourselves across the sea for two and a half weeks until we finally arrived in America. This was on a hot summer day, and when I saw the city of New York for the first time in my life, I opened my mouth and ears; I literally swallowed everything I saw with my eyes, and the strongest and best impression it made on me was how people walked around the city dressed so beautifully…\nI liked this very much and I envied them all. Happy people. Even during the weekdays, they dress up like it’s yontif… Can there be any greater happiness in life?…\nThat’s what I thought then, because even from a young age I liked to dress nicely and keep myself neat. I always wanted to do something that could make my daily life more like a yontif, and that’s why I probably became an actor…\nWe were not in New York for a long time, not even a few hours. From there, we left on a train to Philadelphia, where my sister Bas-Sheyva lived with her husband. And as usual, in the first few days, the happiness was great. After that, people started thinking about what one can do in America to “make a living.” As it turned out, that the best thing I could to “make a living,” in America, was - selling bundles of matches in the streets…\nWhen I heard this, my eyes immediately went dark.\n– What do you mean, selling matches in the streets?! Why did I come to America?\nBut it didn’t help at all; Everyone made me understand that, in America, first of all you have to get the meshugas out of your head, and second, everyone here has to work, because otherwise you can’t “climb the economic ladder.” Other than that, you don’t have to worry about anything in America. The main thing is to earn money and make a living…\nAnd this is how it happened: They hung a cash register around my neck. A cash register with a box of matches. I was placed on South Fifth Street11 and ordered to walk back and forth and exclaim aloud: “Parlor matches, t’ree12 for five! Parlor matches, t’ree for five!” the whole time…\nThe foreign words did not roll off my tongue, even though I learned them well before. I ended up styled them in my own way and it came out something like, “Palner mentsh’t is priper fieft!”\nBut it didn’t take more than a couple of days for me to learn those first English words I knew in America. I had to have a new livelihood, and I was already calling out my goods like a happy merchant, hanging around with a cash box on South Fifth Street in Philadelphia: “Parlor matches, t’ree for five!”\nThis was my first income in America. And I’ve already “made a living” and I was already “alright.”",

    "text": "Selling matches on the streets of Philadelphia became something of a game for me, not just a way to make a living. That’s how I approached it. And little by little I became so interested in the various people who bought the matches from me that I didn’t just call out my goods for sale, but I sang them out in my own way:\n– Parlor matches, three for five! Parlor ma-a-a-tches, three for fi-yi-yi-ve!\nAnd in my mind, something of that nign, which I heard from the badchen Berele Shachnes, lingered…\nI didn’t make any great fortunes, but still I considered myself a “big earner.” And when I bought a suit with my own money and dressed like a real American boy1, I was literally in seventh heaven and felt like no one was my equal.\nThat’s how I passed the time, and I picked up a lot of English in the street, and I even was able to argue even with a policeman. And then a Galician Jew suggested to me that I join him in nearby villages and we could earn a bit of money there. He was a peddler, the Galician Jew, who made the proposal to me; He sold towels and tablecloths and laundry and handkerchiefs and other such things, which he kept in a heavy suitcase. With this suitcase he schlepped around the nearby villages around Philadelphia, and there he already had customers everywhere, even regular customers who bought from him on loan. He toiled hard and saved as much as he could, because he wanted to bring his wife and children to America as soon as possible.\nEvery time he came into our house, he talked about it and complained that he was just a wandering foreigner without a home; He really wanted to have a home and moreover, he really missed his wife and children whom he left behind in a some shtetl in Galicia; He also complained that he had trouble schlepping the heavy suitcase around the surrounding villages, because there was a dog he was afraid of…\nAnd apparently, that is actually why he wanted me to go with him to the villages; I will sell my matches, the “parlor matches” sold at the price of “three for five,” and he will sell his towels and tablecloths and all the other things that he carried in the heavy suitcase. It would be haimlicher.\nHe was sure that with such a smart and lively young man like me, he would no longer need to be afraid of the dog, and moreover, he wouldn’t feel so miserable and he would have someone to speak to in Yiddish. The Galician Jew talked for so long to my mame until she agreed to give her consent for me to join him in the villages. And that’s how I became a villager in America…\nI later picked up the English language in the villages. I even learned a couple of English songs and sang them. And the Galician Jew with the heavy suitcase was very pleased that I had joined him; He wasn’t so lonely and cheerless anymore with me coming along, because I was always happy; In everything I did, above everything else, I found the “comedy”2, and when my heart was in a good place - whether I sold a lot of matches, or for some reason or another - I would sing out at the top of my voice.\nI would sing out the songs I knew - in Yiddish, Ukrainian, and also English - along my way to the nearby villages, and anyone who could spare a shilling would buy matches from me.\nIn one village, a young woman - a Christian - caught my eye; I liked her so much that when I came to her to sell matches, she welcomed me as a very distinguished guest, and it almost became love between us. She twisted my head so much that I walked around bewildered, as though in a haze. But this is something it’s best not to talk about…\nAfter a while3, I was tired of schlepping around the villages, and I was really sick of selling matches. I could no longer say the same thing and the same thing over and over again: “Parlor matches, three for five….” I was simply disgusted by it. And then a landsman4 took me into his shop and taught me the craft of sewing shirts…\nI became a “shirt-maker,”5 as it is called in America, and among the other landsmen who worked there, they said that this is better than pearls, because in America trade/craft is a broche6…\nWorking in the shop was completely different in those days than it is now; People worked longer hours and labored much harder than now. But one of the things that made working in the shop stand out at that time was that people sang while working…\nAnd I really enjoyed that.\nWhat didn’t Jewish workers sing while working in the shop! They knew all the songs from Shulamith7, from Bar Kochba8, and from the other Yiddish plays inside and out. In addition, they knew many other Jewish songs. Beautiful folk songs, which evoked the warmest feelings in everyone. And together with the noise of the machines, or better said, over the noise of the machines which had been working full-speed since the early hours of the night, the air was full of songs of love and other heartfelt Jewish folk nigunim…\nJews who came to America from different countries - from Ukraine, from Lithuania, from Poland, from Galicia, from Romania, and from anywhere else - all worked and sang in the shop. And everyone brought with him a different style, different nuances, and sometimes even a new song that we hadn’t heard before. And everyone sang. We couldn’t not sing while working. It was very difficult to imagine how work in the shop could have gone without it…\nAnd it’s safe to say that we often sang chazenishe9 tunes as well. The workers would sing chazenishe shtiklach10 like this, going up like smoke11. And it was normal that, that in the middle of the day, amidst the noise of the sewing machines, you could hear voices:12\nAnd soon everyone has has joined in, and it would become a “sing-along” in rounds. I remember how once our landsmen in Philadelphia suddenly started making a fuss13 about a new chazn who came to daven14 in the “Russian Shul”15 We heard that he was the brother of the famous chazn Pinie Minkowski, and he came from the city of Belaya Tserkov, which Jews called Sdeh-Levan16 and also Schwartz-Tuma17.\nMore than anyone else, the tumult18 was strongest from the the Belaya Tserkovans. But also the Vasilkovers, the Rybinkers, the Solovinkers, and all the other landsmen who were from that general area. And when everyone went to shul on Shabbes to hear the new chazn, I also went, and I really liked his davening very much. Around the same time, I actually took over a few t’filos19 from him, and then I began to sing them in my own way - both in shul and at work in the shop…\nBut the main thing I want to tell was not that the chazn gave me a few more nigunim to sing, but that I saw a few people davening in the shul who really caught my eye. I didn’t know who they were, these people. Still, I could tell that they must be very important people - this was clear because everyone was looking around with curious glances and whispering to each other. This interested me greatly and when I asked who they were, they told me that they were actors. Yiddish actors. They had come from New York to Philadelphia to perform Yiddish theater.\nThey pointed them out to me one by one, and told me their names:\n– This is Max Karp!\n– That is Moishe Zilberman!\n– And this is Heine-Chaimovich!\nThey were all so young and beautiful and I couldn’t take my eyes off them… Here they are, the great Yiddish actors, about whom I have heard so much!… They came to hear a chazn. They came into the shul to daven - indeed to daven together with all the other Jews…\nThe more I looked at them, the more I was drawn to them. And when I heard afterwards among the landsmen that they, the Yiddish actors who had come from New York, would play Abraham Goldfaden’s Shulamith here in Philadelphia20 - and indeed not just in any theater, but in the beautiful Broad Street Theater - I could not think of anything else. The first chance I got, I went to the theater, and after I managed to get past the crazed crowd that was all around them, I said to them without any other introduction:\n– Take me in, I also want to play theater.\nHe21 smiled when he heard this. He looked me up and down from head to toe, and said:\n– Good. I’ll take you in.\nI thought to myself, he likes me so much that he will take me soon to the very faces of the troupe - to Karp, Zilberman, and Heine-Chaimovich - and he would present me to them. They will soon give me something to do, and I will play a scene with them - just like Berele Shachnes the badchen who was very much on my mind…\nThat’s what I thought. And for a little while, I was really happy with this.\nHowever, it turned out differently: It turned out, they simply needed extras for the performance, and they were looking for Jews in the community who would be eager and interested, so for this, I was hired…\nEven so, I was satisfied. And when they let me out on stage for the first time22 alone with the “folk”23 who were traveling to Jerusalem and singing, “laden with all of our belongings, with walking stick in hand”, I was terrified, but at the same time I felt my heart sing inside me. I was happy. So happy, that I could not imagine any greater happiness in life, and even though I was not in the choir, I still sang with great joy:\nEverything I saw then on the stage enchanted me and I took it all in… Moishe Zilberman in the role of Avisholem, Max Karp in the role of Manoyech, Yosef Vachtel in the role of Tsingetang24, and Moishe Heine-Chaimovich in the role of Natan Chananye. But more than anyone else, I loved the actress who played the role of Shulamith herself…\nSara Adler25 played the role of Shulamith…\nAt that time she was not yet the wife of the famous actor Jacob P. Adler26, the “Nesher Hagadol”27 of the Yiddish stage, as he was called, but the wife of the actor and director Moishe Heine-Chaimovich…\nAnd she was so young and so beautiful! And she played so well then, with so much artistic grace and charisma that I still can’t forget it to this day…\nYears, years, where have you flown?",

    "text": "I played an extra in no more than two or three performances with Heine-Chaimovich and Max Karp’s troupe. After that, they didn’t need me anymore and told me I could go home. As it usually went, they didn’t me pay for it. It didn’t even occur to me to ask to be paid.\nIn general, Yiddish troupes at that time would recruit local men and women to be “the folk” in the play1. In every city there were more than a few people who rushed to the stage for this, and were satisfied just to be so close to the great performers who they used to talk about with such enthusiasm. The stage drew them in like a magnet. And some of them actually became actors and actresses - and more than one of them made it to the top ranks and became famous…\nIn the shop where I worked as a shirt-maker, the spirit of Yiddish theater pervaded more than ever; there was no one who didn’t take the opportunity to go see the troupe who came from New York to Philadelphia for only a few performances. And since everyone knew I was on the stage with them, I was greatly exalted. They would request from me,\n– Nu, Sam, how does that song go that they sing in that one scene? Nu, how?\nAnd I didn’t make them beg, and I sang. And more than any other song, I sang \"Rozhinkes mit Mandlen\"2 I had to sing it for them several times a day, and everyone used to sing with me. And it started like this3:\nAnd then everyone in the shop, amidst the noise of the machines, immediately joined in as though they were all “fully qualified”:\nAnd so it went, just as if we were, here in the shop, putting on our own performance. And after the “ai-liu-liu”s were done, I continued:\nLike this, all day long, I sang. And after the sung, everyone “licked their fingers”4 over it.\n– Yes, that is good!\n– Yes, that is sweet as sugar!\n– Brava, Mogulesko! Brava, Mogulesko!\nHis talent spread like a rumor at those times, when Jews would come to see him play Yiddish theater in cities like Odessa and Iasi. It was in those times that the Yiddish theater was starting to pick up speed7.\nMogulesko came to Philadelphia to play the piece Di Kokete Damen8 where he could show himself in all his glory.9 He played the role of the libertine who later becomes old and broken and no longer recognizable. And in the same performance, he also appeared in the role of Bobe Shprintze10. And when he started singing the song \"Yankele\"11, everyone remained seated as if glued to their seats, and they swallowed every word and really kvelled from the song.\nAnd Mogulesko performed the role of Bobe Shprintze with such grace and such charm, that it was no wonder that he enchanted the whole audience. Oh, how beautifully and how sweetly he sang!\nWhat a song Mogulesko sang - even when the words didn’t rhyme, it was such a pleasure to listen to him sing it that it didn’t matter. You really couldn’t believe it, how he charmed the audience with his artistic grace. You’d have to travel the whole world over to find another artist as good as him.\nAnd I remember that when I saw him for the first time, in Philadelphia in the play Di Kokete Damen, I remained seated as though I had suddenly been transported to an entirely different world. And when the curtain fell and they turned the lights back on in the theater, I jumped up on stage and went behind the curtain.\nI felt that I had to say something to him, the man who performed such wonders on the stage. I had to express my enthusiasm!13 I had to touch his hand! I had to thank him for the spiritual pleasure that he had given me.\nThis feeling gripped me so tightly that there was nothing I could do to escape it. I suddenly just forgot that, fundamentally, I have a reserved/shy nature, not like someone who elbows their way in somewhere. And when I went behind the curtain and said, that I had to see Mogulesko, they passed me from person to person. And it went on like this until a Jew14 loomed up from underground - a healthy Jew, a tall Jew, who spoke in such a way that you could immediately recognize he was Romanian; he told me to follow him, and while leading me, he shouted out loud:\n– Hey, Zeligl15, some guy asked to see you…\nAnd I still remember how strange it was to me, that this man used a nickname - for Mogulesko himself! - as though they were equals… He called him Zeligl…\nWhen I was introduced to Mogulesko in his dressing room and I suddenly realized how near I was to him, I was left standing in a daze and I suddenly forgot everything that I had planned to say to him16. Only when Mogulesko stretched out his hand to me and I saw a good face, a kind face, I mustered the courage and I started to say,\n– It is an honor for me, a great honor, to shake your head… I thank you…\nHe was, it seems, used to things like this, so he smiled, and then I became even bolder:\n– And I tell you now, Mister Mogulesko, that I want to be actor just like you… I mean, I want to be actor.\nImmediately after, I was shocked that I said that; it occurred to me that it was a chutzpe17 for me to have said something like, “Mogulesko is an actor, and I want to be an actor!” Who am I and what did I do?! And what does it mean that “I want”? Well, it means that is what I want!\nBut Mogulesko wasn’t offended by what I had said. “Good,” he replied. “This pleases me. And if you indeed become an actor, we will certainly see each other again…”\nThen he became very busy and I could not spend any more time with him. As I was leaving, I shook his hand, and I wanted to say so much more to him, but I didn’t say anything…\nAt that time, neither of us could have imagined that, years later, I would play his roles on the Yiddish stage and he himself would say that I did not “embarrass” him18 and that he was pleased with me.\nThis was my first encounter with Mogulesko, the great and God-blessed artist, from whom I learned so much over the years while he lived and created great theater here in America. And this encounter took place in Philadelphia, a city which is so intimately linked with my career on the Yiddish stage. This meeting is so etched in memory, that now the whole scene is floating before my eyes. I could not forget what he said to me, that if I indeed become an actor, we will certainly see each other again.\nAnd after he left Philadelphia, back in the stop here I worked, everyone already knew that I had the privilege to introduce myself to him and speak to him himself, so I was exalted and “crowned.” Everyone wanted to know what he said to me and what I said to him - not just the workers in the shop, but the boss himself was curious about this too. And I told them all about it. But the way I told it, I made it seem like I didn’t talk to Mogulesko for only a few minutes, but instead for hours and hours…\nThat’s how deep of an impression he left on me. And then everyone in the shop started singing \"Yankele\" which they sung more than any other song, and some of them wanted to sing it exactly as Mogulesko did. And when someone thought they wouldn’t be able to sing it like Mogulesko, they would turn to me and say,\n– Nu, Sam, you show us how to sing it like Mogulesko does…\nAnd I showed them, and they told me it was good.\nWe sang other songs from the play Di Kokete Damen too, in the shop in Philadelphia where I worked sewing shirts. And among the popular songs we used to sing, there was also the song \"B’shtika\"19 and as I recall, it went like this:\nThe song is composed of several people21. The song also makes fun of the of the “ultra-religious hypocrites” who pretend to be frum, but in reality they are not. The song also made fun of wealthy women, who cannot make good housewives. And it ended with a bang:\nAnd indeed one more time:\nThat was the kind of song that was sung in the Yiddish theater in those days; a song the audience would immediately pick up and start singing everyone - at home and in the shop22. And it didn’t matter what kind of song it was, a good or a bad one - the song was always a Jewish song and it pulled at the Jewish people’s heartstrings…",

    "text": "Making the acquaintance of Mogulesko put me in such a daze that I couldn’t take working in the shop at all. Everything I saw of him on stage always floated before my eyes. I remembered every movement he made, every expression that appeared on his face. His unique stage grace which really has no equal was so deeply engraved in my memory that I could never forget it. And because I was always thinking so much about Mogulesko and the show he played in Philadelphia, I started to yearn to act in the theater even more than before.\nI simply wanted to begin my life as an actor. The stage cast a spell on me. But every time, when I started talking about this at home, mame would cut off my wings:\n– Get this stupidity out of your head - she said. - Like we don’t have enough actors in the family…3\nIt was difficult for me to cause mame such grief; I have always behaved so that she should not suffer any shame from me. In this case, however, I could not obey her, as I had firmly made up my mind that, should there even be thunder and lightning, I must be an actor!\nA short time after Mogulesko left, the actor Jacob Gartenstein arrived in Philadelphia with a troupe. When I heard this, I was very interested and knew that I should go talk to him and convince him to give me an opportunity to play some kind of role. He was a very unique person, Jacob Gartenstein, and it’s worth mentioning some details of his biography here:\nHe is from Ukraine, and he came to America after the first pogroms of 1881 and 1882. He was one of the first Yiddish actors that Goldfaden recruited when he created the Yiddish theater. And the other actors considered him to be an educated man; He spoke very good English and he also spoke Russian, German and French. That’s what they said. He was associated with the Yiddish theater for a few years and even though he was not one of the great actors, he was an innovator, and indeed a bit of a swindler, too4. And when he realized he wouldn’t make it big on the stage, he suddenly opened a beer saloon in Philadelphia, and it didn’t go poorly. But for some reason, which he kept secret, he had to give up the beer saloon, and he left Philadelphia for Chicago.\nAnd what did he do in Chicago?\nThere, he completely turned away from the Yiddish theater and began to play the role of an intellectual, of the philosopher, and he became the president of some lodge, which bore the name of the famous philosopher Spinoza, and he gave lectures. And at the same time, he got involved with politics - with American politics. And once he was even a candidate for Congress5 and during the race he gave fiery “campaign speeches”6. But he was not elected.\nAfter the First World War, he suddenly started calling himself “Dr. Gartenstein.” But he was neither a doctor of medicine, nor a doctor of philosophy, nor of any other field…\nAnd he died in Chicago. Died suddenly of a heart attack.\nAll around, he was a very interesting character, Jacob Gartenstein; Fifty-sixty years ago, he was one of the pillars on which the Jewish community in America stood. When writing about the Yiddish theater of the old days, you have to mention him. And I have to mention him for myself too because of his connection to my career on the Yiddish stage in America - he gave me my first role to play in a show.\nAt that time, Gartenstein was playing Goldfaden’s play Di Kishefmacherin in Philadelphia. The troupe consisted of several distinguished people, and among them, I remember, was Yosef Vachtel7, Mendele Abramovich, Feyvele Fridman and Mendel Teplitzky; Like many other Yiddish theater directors who traveled around the provinces8, Gartenstein also relied on the fact that he would soon find enough “haimishe talent”9 among the young Jewish boys and girls who wanted to act in the theater in Philadelphia. I, too, was one of them10, and in Di Kishefmacherin, he gave me the role of the young little scoundrel Elyokum11, who twists the old witch’s head and is always tricking her out of money.\nWhen he gave a copy of the role, he told me, that I should memorize it well so that I will remember everything by heart, and as he thought that I already had experience also the stage, he did not consider it necessary to explain to me what a replik12 was. I went home and I learned the few written pages by heart, and when I came to the rehearsals, I called out all my lines at once, and I thought that I did well.\nEveryone laughed, and I didn’t understand why they were laughing at the fact that I knew my whole role by heart. Only when Gartenstein explained to me what a replik was - he told me that this was the last line someone else said and that afterwards I had to pick up the prose and speak my lines - did I begin to understand the problem. And then things went such there was no more need to laugh at me.\nIn general, people learned to act not before they went up on the stage, but only after they had already become a professional actor; All the talents that came to the Yiddish stage at that time were what is called samorodne13; They didn’t go to any dramatic schools, they didn’t study anywhere, but they were drawn to the stage and playing theater had such an appeal for them, and they were so enchanted by it that no force in the world could turn them away from it.\nAt the time, my performance was highly commended, so I was told. I, too, was pleased with how I played the little con artist, who twists the old sorceress’ head and cheats her out of money. I was even more pleased that, through performing the part, I realized how beautiful Goldfaden’s play was. I liked the whole play so much that even when I wasn’t on stage, I positioned myself behind the scenes so that I wouldn’t miss seeing a single scene and that I could hear the songs they sang well.\nAnd even now everything seems alive before my eyes and I hear the singing. The butcher also comes out on the stage, a healthy young man, a man of iron, and even before he opened his mouth, everyone in the theater already knew what he will soon sing and they all know the melody very well; They know the tune because they’ve seen Goldfaden’s play more than once, and all the nigunim in the play are so close to their hearts that they would listen to each song over and over again. They are very fond of these nigunim and they would often sing them to themselves - at home, in the shop at work, and everywhere. They are familiar with all roles. And when they see the butcher on the stage, they nudge one another with their elbows and this meant: Soon you will hear, there will soon be a song…\nAnd soon they indeed heard:\nLyrics in Yiddish that are too complicated/poetic for this humble translator.\nThe faces of the entire audience in the theater lit up with joy. They were so pleased that they hear exactly what they wanted, and the singing continued…\nLyrics.\nThe audience in the theater knew that this is not the end of the song, but they couldn’t help but applaud. And the actor who played the butcher realized that now the audience was fully engaged, and he continued to sing:\nLyrics.\nThe audience kvelled and really came alive with this song. And every time when an actor on stage excelled with a song, the others in the troupe were very jealous of them, and they waited anxiously, looking forward to the moment when they would also be able to show what they could do, how they could be even better in front of the audience. And when it came to the popular song \"Bobkelach\"14, there were already people in the theater who couldn’t resist the temptation and sang along:\nLyrics.\nIn singing the song \"Bobkelach\", Gartenstein borrowed a little poem/verse from a well-known chazn in Philadelphia. And he sang it in such a way that it was really a pleasure to listen to:\nLyrics.\nIn particular after the part in the marketplace where everyone starts singing “Buy, buy customers,” and then the great show become even grander, when Hotsmach came around with his little tune:\nLyrics.\nAnd after a little bit, another song:\nLyrics.\nTogether with the audience, I was so moved by the performance, both on stage and behind the curtain, that I felt like I was in seventh heaven, and when I danced so unexpectedly in the role of Elyokum, it wasn’t because I was supposed to dance like that, but because of what was right in my heart at the time…\nAt that performance in Philadelphia, all of my family were there, and my mame was among them. They all said that I was very good in the role of the scoundrel Elyokum. But I really wanted to know what my mame had to say about it. And when I asked her how she liked me in the role, she just waved her hand.\n– Know what I think!… You are meshuga15, that’s all…\nShe had nothing more to say about it. Frankly, I resented this. What does it mean I’m meshuga?… I played theater, showed everyone that I was an actor and she says I am meshuga!",

    "text": "In those days, people used to play for “stamps”2, and the actors could not behave peacefully around themselves, because every time they had to split the pitiful3 earnings among themselves, each one was sure that an injustice was being done to him, and he had grievances. Also in Gartenstein’s troupe, who came to play Yiddish theater in Philadelphia, the actors used to fight. And these fights ended with the troupe splitting into two, and both left Philadelphia to try their luck in other cities.\nThat’s usually how it went when one troupe became two. Playing at Gartenstein’s got my head so twisted that I couldn’t work in the shop anymore. I convinced myself that it no longer suited me to work in a shop. I opened a sort of dance class and in the evenings I taught young boys and girls to dance, and from this I got “water on porridge”4. But I was still satisfied, because dancing has a bit of a relationship to theater…\nAt that time, the actor Rudolph Marks5 came down to Philadelphia with a troupe. And as soon as I heard this, I immediately went to him.\n– Take me in, - I requested of him. - I want to play theater and even more, I’d really be a great fit for your troupe.\nHe was a very good actor, Rudolph Marks, and besides, he came from a very nice family, and they said that his father was a very great scholar who also wrote books in the loshn-koydesh6. He himself, Rudolph Marks, was also an intelligent young man, and later he actually studied to be a lawyer and gave up the stage. But in the years when he was an actor, great hopes were placed on him and he was greatly praised, but the trouble with him was that what he really wanted was for people to consider him as great an actor as Mogulesko, and he made every effort to be a Mogulesko.\nIn Philadelphia, Rudolph Marks performed a play which he translated from English, and the play was called, I remember, Saylor in Gefar7 I didn’t ask Rudolph Marks for any money for my acting. It never occurred to me to ask him for money for my acting. I was satisfied with what he immediately gave me to play the role of a boy who sells newspapers in the streets, and I diligently began to study this role, and I was sure that I would play it very well. But when I arrived to the second or third rehearsal, Rudolph Marks took the role from me and told me to go home.\nThey didn’t need me anymore… why?\nBecause Rudolph Marks realized that, just as Mogulesko had shown, he also wanted to show that he could play not just one role, but two and even three roles in one play, and indeed each all different sorts of character. And he decided that on top of the two roles that he was already playing, he should also play the role of the boy who sells newspapers in the streets…\nLet Philadelphia see what he can do, and let them say he doesn’t show the same skills as Mogulesko!…\nAnd then something happened that is very characteristic of how things were. You could get away with things like this I could afford to do it in the meantime, and it is therefore worth telling here:\nTogether with a landsman of mine, who fell in with what I am going to tell here, I went to the theater where Rudolph Marks played the Saylor in Gefar. We sat there at every performance, and listening to every word, we transcribed the whole play, and afterwards we pieced it together in our own way, and indeed right away we put together our own troupe, rented the Dramatic Hall8, and there we performed the same play, indeed our own Saylor in Gefar that Rudolph Marks had played. And just like him, I played all three roles in the play, and people said it was good.\nIt had to be good, because I did the same as him in all three roles. I simply imitated him, and it was successful for me… He then became very angry with me, and threatened he would get even with me for this. But it didn’t save him at all.\nWhenever a Yiddish troupe came to Philadelphia, I was the first to present myself to them to be given a role to play. And when Boris Thomashefsky9 came down to play in Philadelphia and he staged the play Kibed Ov, he gave me the role of some shames10, and that, I think, was the first time I wore a beard on stage and played an older Jew11.\nIncidentally, I didn’t give up that beard after playing there. Sometime later when I was working again in the shop where, as it used to go in those times, we sung Yiddish theater songs while working, all it took was for me to stroke my beard and call out some song, and the mood would be lively and cheerful.\nOnce, when I was at work in the shop, my sister Donia suddenly burst into the shop with some big news:\n– Sam! - she shouted with joy. - We’ve had a stroke of luck: I won ten thousand dollars!…\nShe won the ten thousand dollars in some lottery, and that brought a lot of joy to our family and we were suddenly prosperous.\nThen my mother started to argue with me that I should knock “this mishugas” out of my head, meaning meant that I should no longer think about such a thing as becoming an actor.\n– It’s not for you, Shmuel’ik - she said to me, calling me by my haimishe name. - This is only for an idler, for a loafer, but not for you…\nShe was always looking for ways to get me to knock “this mishugas” out of my head. The others in the family were also looking for ways to get me away from it. And because of that, they bought me a farm in Bridgeton, New Jersey12, and I became a farmer.\nI then worked for a long time on the farm which was bought for me, but I confess that my head was not with me at work, because the whole time I was thinking about theater and dreaming about playing on the stage. But my mame did everything she could to make me forget about this, and once I even had to keep her my word that I wouldn’t become an actor…\nShe was very satisfied with this, and she did everything in her power for me to feel at home on the farm so that I would stop dreaming of the theater, but you could still see, that it was clear that she was still aggrieved that I was lonesome and sad on the farm while still dreaming so much about the theater.\nYou could see this, but she didn’t say anything about it.\nSo a long time passed, and once when I was busily working on the farm, my sister came running to me, out of breath -\n– Sam, come quickly; Something has happened to mame!\nFrightened, I rushed back home, and when I entered, I was even more frightened; mame was lying in bed, unable to speak, and her face was as pale as the wall.\nIt took several weeks before she regained the ability to speak. But it was difficult for her to speak, and once, when I and the rest of the family were sitting with her, she took me by the hand and began to speak to me in a way that everyone could hear:",

    "text": "The whole time that I yearned to be a professional actor, I was drawn to New York. There was the center of Yiddish theater; there the greatest Yiddish actors played there, and I really wanted to play with them. But even as my desire to play with them in New York was so great, I was still afraid of them, but in general the city of New York did not scare me much4.\nAnd it was no wonder that I was so frightened of them, of the famous actors of that time. There was something about them that really plunged you into fear and yet really stirred the imagination; They had a innumerable fans, who were ready to “jump into fire and water”5 for them; All the walls were covered with their pictures, and even their names were wrapped in something unusual: Abba Schoengold called himself “Yaffa-Zahav”6 - that’s how he translated his name to Hebrew, so that it would sound nice and shiny. And Jacob P. Adler called himself no other name than the “Nesher HaGadol”7 And when he used to came down with his troupe to a provincial town, a picture of an eagle with two heads was printed on his posters, along with a warning to other others who were playing in the provinces:\n– Fly away, little birds - the Great Eagle is here!\nThat was usually how the wording was…\nAh, what tales were told about the great actors and their caprices!\nNu, it was indeed no wonder that I was frightened to come to them in New York, even though I was really drawn there…\nThat’s why I didn’t go to try my luck in New York, but I came back to Philadelphia from the farm in Bridgeton, and there I met the actor Jacob Frank, who then ran a barber shop. He was a very good actor and an excellent comedian, but he had no ambition in the slightest. And even more, he was pretty lazy and he never had any motivation to really study a role.\nIn his certainty that when he goes out on the stage, everything would be fine and he would be able to “cope”8, he neglected everything. But with his talent was able to get away with a lot of things9. And you can say, that in a better “theater-atmosphere” Jacob Frank would certainly have been more prominent and he would certainly have occupied a more honorable place on our Yiddish stage, and his talent would have developed better.\nBut it was not destined for him to be in a better “theater–atmosphere.” And that’s how he lived out all his years, and is now completely gone from the world10 and he has been forgotten.\nTogether, Frank and I established a little theater company that we called the “Star Specialty Club”11. And the manager of the club, I remember, was a young man from Philadelphia named Staller, a cigar maker, who was studying medicine and later become a doctor12.\nWhenever we could and wherever we were allowed, we gave concerts, staged scenes, sang, and danced. We were satisfied that we were playing theater, and we looked forward to the opportunity when we would achieve what we wanted.13.\nI will never forget that performance for the rest of my life. It was the first time I remember playing theater where they wrote about it afterwards in the newspaper. I was really delighted that I had already achieved such a level, even though at the same time I was afraid that Edelstadt especially, chalilah15, would not enjoy it.\nBut Edelstadt did enjoy our performance in Philadelphia; he affirmed this in the speech he gave between acts of the play, and afterwards in what he wrote in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime, and with this writing he put us all in a very good mood.\nFor a long time, we went through such tumult in the “Star Specialty Club” of ours, and it didn’t really matter to us that we didn’t have much luck. The point was that we had the opportunity to play theater, and we even had our own fans, just like the stars in New York. And that alone is no small thing.\nAmong our fans, I recall, there was one named Herman. He was working as a cloak operator, “Columbus’ craftsman,” as those who took up tailoring in America were called at that time16. And he, Herman, was a strong supporter17 of Frank’s, and since he was a bit of a dreykop18 he already had a plan that he would grab Frank, and with him19, leave for Baltimore, because he20 had a lot of relatives and landslayt21 there. And he was sure that there they would accomplish lots of great things, and they will both make golden business with the theater.\nI am describing all these details here simply because, I believe, that it is worth getting knowing about, in order to have an sense of those types who hung around the theater, and how such chaos and such mayhem ruled the Yiddish theater in the provincial towns.\nOf all the dreams that Herman had when he grabbed Frank and took him from Philadelphia to Baltimore, nothing came of it. The Jews in Baltimore could not be taken by storm, as Herman had originally imagined. And on top of that, Frank “played a trick” on him - in Baltimore, he fell in love with a beautiful girl, and in his love his head was so twisted that playing theater was hardly in his mind at all…\nBut Herman didn’t give up. He had long decided that he must accomplish something in the Yiddish theater and show what he is capable of. And when he came back to Philadelphia from Baltimore “with baytshel,” as we used to say in Ukraine22, he teamed up with a certain “sign-painter,” whose name was Shapiro. He, Shapiro, was also a great lover of Yiddish theater, and in addition just as much of a dreykop as Herman, and he didn’t have any plans anyways. But soon he had a plan for me:\n– You want, we should all go in together? - he says to me, – You want New Yorkers to start talking about you and the earth will quake for you23, ah?… Are you coming with us to Brownsville?!\n– What’s in Brownsville? - I asked.\n– What do you mean, “What’s in Brownsville?”?! - Shapiro said excitedly to me as if he were about to curse me. - You don’t know what Brownsville is? Brownsville is a growing Jewish city, people are building it up, and the Jews will delight in having a Yiddish theater. You will be carried around proudly on your head24…\nHe did not have the slightest doubt that this would indeed be the case. And so that there would be no doubt for me either, he continued to reply to show there was something real and tangible on top of just the fantasy.\nAnd so it goes without saying that when they made me the offer to go from Philadelphia to Brownsville to play Yiddish theater, it really did not occur to me to go anywhere without her…\nAnd so, it turned out like this: Together with the dark-haired, charming girl Suzie Schafer, with whom I was so deeply in love that I could not part with in any way, I, with many hopes, left for Brownsville. And I was sure that it was going to be good, because Brownsville is close to New York, and that alone was really tempting to me, because I wanted to be near the city that was the center of Yiddish theater in America…",

    "text": "This was still in those times when in Brownsville, yidishkeyt1 was felt at every turn. And even more than during the week, you could feel it on Shabbes2. The shuls were packed. Jews went to pray, and just like in the shtetl in the old country, they took the children with them. And walking to the shul, they dressed up for Shabbes and put on the tall black top hats on their heads, and in the street they all gave one another a gut Shabbos and we everyone lived together as one big mishpucha who suddenly felt the good taste of what it is like for Jews to live in a free country where you don’t have to be afraid of anyone and where you can walk around the streets with your head held high.\nThere in Brownsville, it wouldn’t occur to even the greatest apikores3 to do such a thing as light a cigarette on Shabbes in the middle of the street; He would be afraid to do such a thing, or people would shame him for doing it.\nAnd everywhere, wherever we walked and wherever we stood, we saw how they were building and building; Everyone bought lots, everyone had plans, and whoever was able to undertake it, was drawn into the momentum of building the city, which later became one of the greatest Jewish cities in the world4.\nEveryone in Brownsville spoke amiably about the mud and filth5. People did not complain about it. They were not ashamed of it. And in that alone there was also a characteristic haimishe comfort.\nEverything in Brownsville at that time had a genuine Yiddish style, and when you walked down the street and heard people speaking their own haimishe kind of Yiddish, you could recognize who came from where and you already knew who was who - Who is a Litvak, who is a Galicianer, who comes from Poland, and who from Ukraine6.\nAnd from the open windows of the houses, songs spread through the air - popular songs from the Yiddish theater, or Yiddish folk songs of all kinds. And here and there someone would even try out the kehele7 and he sang chazenishe chants and would trill, simply for his own enjoyment, so that he would feel at home/at ease in America…\nSuch a city was of course fit for a Yiddish theater. I was sure of this. Naturally, I immediately got to work, and the first play that we played there was Boris Thomashefsky’s Aliles Dam, oder Menachem Ben-Yisroel. That’s what the play was called; One name for a play was not enough, and therefore people usually added an “or” well…\nAfter that we played another play, indeed again with an “or,” as the style was: Di Chalitse, oder Velvele Est Kompot was the name of that play, and it was adapted by Thomashefsky8.\nAbout such a thing as getting permission to play a play, there was very little concern. On top of that, I was already in touch with Thomashefsky because his wife Bessie and I were relatives,9 and Thomashefsky himself already knew me well and he got along very well with me10.\nThe first couple of weeks in Brownsville didn’t go badly, and I got exactly my salary - ten dollars a week. But after that it started to get worse and worse, until it became so bad that we received no salary and couldn’t pay rent anymore.\nIt was bad for me then, very bad. And in the moments when I was miserable and I was looking for a way to improve my dark fate, I used to spend time with the actors of the other troupe who were, at that time, playing in another casino in Brownsville11. And during that time I became close friends with the actor Charlie Cohan12, who is now the Secretary-Treasurer of the Hebrew Actors' Union, and also with Sigmond Weintraub, who was not only a very good actor, but also a decent person, and moreover very smart and had a fine sense of humor.\nWe were all still young then, full of life; We could even make fun of our own troubles; I didn’t allow myself any very big and heavy worries, and it was therefore a completely natural thing, that in such a time, when things were so bad and I wasn’t receiving a salary, it should occur to me, that now is precisely the right time to get married…13\nThought and done - I got married to the charming dark-haired girl Suzie, with whom I was so deeply in love.\nAnd we held the wedding in our own way - with a benefit performance at Parmer’s Casino. And all in all, the benefit brought in about thirty-five dollars. And after the religious ceremony, we had bread with herring and drank a little real liquor and it was lively and joyous.\nI didn’t know myself what would happen next. I relied on miracles, and - a miracle really did happen…\nThe miracle was that well-known actor Yisroel Weinblatt, one of the first pioneers on the Yiddish stage, told me that he wanted to buy my farm from me; He had decided, he said, to become an actor, but it would be better for him to be a farmer, and his greatest dream was that his children would also be farmers; He didn’t want them to be actors…\nYisroel Weinblatt resolved to become a farmer because he had been sidelined by theater politics and no longer stood out14. This greatly angered him; He felt very offended by this, because earlier he was loved by the public and he excelled in such roles as Shmerke the servant in Shomer’s Di Kokete Damen, Kalman Kroch in Yitzhak Yoel Linetzky’s Dos Poylishe Yingl15, and Hotsmach in Abraham Goldfaden’s Bobe Yachne. He excelled in other roles as well, and he could not forget that. And because it hurt him so much that he was pushed into a corner and no longer given the opportunities on the stage that were given to him before, it seemed to him that he no longer had anything left to do there, and that the best thing for him would be to become a farmer…\n– You, Kasten, - he said to me - you left the farm to become an actor, and I go there to become a former actor…\nYisroel Weinblatt paid me five hundred dollars in cash for the farm, and as soon as he settled there, he set to work diligently. And I remember how once, when I came to him in the afternoon and met him while he was working in the field, he told me with a smile that his son Charlie - the same Charlie who years later became the well-known lawyer for the theater - was still sleeping, and farmwork was not on his mind at all…\n– You see, Kasten, - the old Yisroel Weinblatt said to me in a joking way tone - you see, he doesn’t have to work. But I am an orphan, without a father or a mother, so I have to work. There is no other choice…\nAbove all, Yisroel Weinblatt was always ready with a joke. Even when his heart was heavy, he could still make jokes, and it was not difficult to see that even though he left the stage, he wanted to return to it. And he tried several times to make a comeback, but it never worked out for him.\nBy the way, around that time Rudolph Marks also left the Yiddish stage, and when he finished studying law, he became a lawyer, and it was said that he used to say: “Better this way; I’m not going to be Mogulesko”…\nThe five hundred dollars that Yisroel Weinblatt gave me for the farm really opened my eyes. I immediately assembled a troupe in Brownsville, and I went to Newark to play Yiddish theater and before I knew it, I had spent two hundred dollars there and I already became a poorer man. But it didn’t work out and I went with my troupe to play in Passaic, and from Passaic to Bridgeport. And when I came back to Brownsville, there was nothing left of the five hundred dollars. I was left without a penny.\nIn general, Yiddish actors suffered a lot at that time, and this further exacerbated the chaos and confusion which was already so pervasive in our miserable theater-atmosphere. Everyone wandered around lost, everything happened by chance, and you couldn’t know what tomorrow would bring and what paths you would take…\nEveryone did what they wanted or whatever occurred to them. And the greatest chaos, as I have already said, reigned in those troops who also played in the provinces…\nRight then, when I came back to Brownsville, without a cent to my name, it was nearly Pesach. Nu, I was sure that during Pesach, the people of Brownsville would come to Parmer’s Casino to see Yiddish theater. How else?16 And I expected we would have great luck and I made all the plans. But no one came to the first performance that we announced. Really, no one. Not a single Jew… No one came to the second performance either…\nAnd the same thing happened in the casino, where Charlie Cohan and Sigmond Weintraub played. No one went there on the yontif either…\nIt was just as though everyone had discussed it among themselves and agreed not to go…\nMy heart was heavy at that time. And I kept thinking about one question: What will happen next? What, after all, will it be…?",

    "text": "The whole Pesach yontif came and went, and not a single Jew came to our theater. And after the yontif was over, we came up with a new idea for how to attract the Jewish community of Brownsville to come to our performances in Parmer’s Casino: we let it be known that we would play theater for free…\nYes, for free. No one will have to pay any money for a ticket. You won’t even need a ticket at all. The only thing you will need is - come to drink beer and pay for it, and then you will enter from the saloon into the main hall where the theater is, sit down wherever you can get a spot, and there you’ll see a performance.\nThis, the public in Brownsville was interested in, and they started coming to drink beer and actually see a Yiddish show along with it. Then the casino was able to pay my salary, and I started to earn a little bit of money. But really only a little. We didn’t have much luck.\nThat’s how Yiddish theater was in Brownsville in those days. And when a Jew wanted to see a proper performance, he usually would go to New York2 where “the bears,” the famous actors of the Yiddish stage, played.\nAround that time my wife gave birth to our first child3, and I my situation was such that only God alone could take pity on me. If it weren’t for the few fans I had in Brownsville, my situation would certainly have been much worse. My fans, simple but good and kind people, helped me out with whatever they could. But they couldn’t do much for me, because they themselves were also very poor and they also toiled hard for a piece of bread.\nSo what could I do? I went to Thomashefsky and asked him to save me.\n– You have to do something for me - I said to him - as a member of the family, you have to help me out. Don’t forget that I am now a father of a child, and there are times when I simply have no bread at home…\nIt was difficult for me to speak like that, because that was not at all my nature, but I had no other choice.\nAnd Thomashefsky promised me that he would come to Brownsville to play a show at Parmer’s Casino especially for me, and all the proceeds would go to me.\nNu, I was certainly very pleased with this. And I was even more pleased that he chose to play the piece Ester fun Eyn-Gedi4 for the evening performance. This was one of the most popular plays among Jews at that time, and I was sure that people would be packed in the casino like sardines, and there would be a lot of proceeds.\nAs he was wont to do, Thomashefsky also brought his bravado and his “actor’s caprices;” he ordered everything to be prepared so that nothing would go wrong, and he also had all the decorations for the production of the play Ester fun Eyn-Gedi brought in from New York.\nAnd if Thomashefsky wants it, you must obey…\nThis ended up costing a lot of money even before the night of the performance. And when it came to the performance, the early proceeds were not much, because most of the Jews of Brownsville had already seen Thomashefsky play Ester fun Eyn-Gedi in New York. They didn’t want to see him in the same play again. And in the end, when we counted all the proceeds, all in all the performance only brought in something like $12…\nIn desperation, I then turned to the actor Max Karp, who then, just like Thomashefsky, had a big name, and the audiences really loved to hear him sing. He actually had a very pleasant voice, the actor Max Karp, and his voice had a distinct appeal to it. In addition, he had a fine posture and the kind of good affect that usually makes an impression on an audience. It turned out that he would come to Brownsville especially for my sake to attract an audience to a performance; We would play the piece Chayim in Amerike, and he, Max Karp, would sing between the acts.\nThis saved me from all my troubles. When the people in Brownsville heard that Max Karp was going to sing, they gladly came to Parmer’s Casino to hear him, and the most interesting thing about it was that they wanted to hear exactly the songs that they had already heard him sing before…\nIt turns out, it’s not the same with singing as it is with a play; when it comes to singing, you can listen to something you enjoy many times, and the closer a song is to your heart, the more you want to hear it still…\nEven to this day, I can’t forget the enthusiasm he was met with when he went out on stage to sing and what an ovation he received after he sang the first song:\nAnd the enthusiasm grew even greater when he began to sing Mogulesko’s song \"Min Hameiztar\"6, which was very popular at the time:\nLike all the songs that Mogulesko wrote during the years he wrote for the Yiddish stage7, his song \"Min Hameiztar\", also had a meaning; it evoked feelings and memories. And his creations had a genuine Jewishness to them, his is still authentically Yiddish both in their subject and in their melody. And Max Karp knew how to bring this out, and when he sang Mogulesko’s \"Min Hameiztar\" again, the crowd echoed every word:\nAnd then the singing went in the form of a question and an answer:\nNowadays, no one remembers the song \"Min Hameiztar\", but in those times I’m telling about here, this song was famous to and beloved by Jews, and this was not for no reason; the song was not only about the tsures the Jews endured, but also about Jewish hopes, and it reminded you of what you were once taught in cheder. Next, the song next went like this:\nAnd here comes the song again in the form of a question and answer:\nThe story about the miracle of Purim is not left out in that song, and this part was sung so that Jews would remember that they outlived all their bitter enemies:\nAnd then the “וואס איהם פארשאפט האס אזא קראפט” part comes again, and so on.\nJews really loved this song. It was sung everywhere. And it’s no wonder that Max Karp took it very seriously when he sang it at my benefit performance in Brownsville between acts.\nAnd on top of this, the financial success from it was also great - the event brought me $150, and that saved me…\nBut I couldn’t stay in Brownsville any longer. It was clear to me that there was no luck for me there and I started thinking about where I should go and try my luck in what kind of state I should settle in. America is large. There are many states in the country. But what kind of state should I go to?",

    "text": "There is so much to say about the famous Yiddish actors of those times, but I have to add one thing: they did not limit themselves to New York as the only city where you could play Yiddish theater. They thought that in America, there are endless cities with Jews, and Yiddish theater should be played there not only after the end of the New York season, but also during the season, exactly as they did in New York.\nThis started because even the well-known Yiddish actors of those times always had to be on the lookout for ways to make a living. In addition, it was often difficult for them to empathize with one another because of professional jealousy. So, throughout their journey traveling around the cities, they were always looking for opportunities to have greater prestige than in New York. And in their travels, they made Yiddish theater popular among the Jewish public in America and, as they say today, they “spread the Jewish word.”\nAll the beauty of the how Yiddish theater was once performed across the country accomplished something - if among the long-standing1 Jews in America who are estranged from us find themselves remembering from long ago a beautiful Yiddish tune, an old one, and because of that feel more connected to the Jewish people, the traveling actors of old certainly had a part in that.\nThat’s how I think of it. And there is no doubt in my mind that many who are familiar with the history of the Yiddish theater in America will agree that I am right.\nAmong the actors, who traveled a lot across America and played everywhere there was a considerable Jewish population, was also Abba Schoengold, one of the first pioneers who created the Yiddish theater. He was by nature one of those who was always looking for something, and even though he was lazy in his pursuit, there was something in him that reminded me of an artistic pursuit.\nI remember once, in the middle of winter, just when I was in Brownsville having great troubles, Abba Schoengold came to me with something great:\n– Kasten, you don’t have to worry anymore; We are going to Boston!\n– And what will we do in Boston?\n– What do you mean? We will play theater there and we will earn money.\nAt that time, he was so involved in the plan he had devised, that he just didn’t listen to what I was talking to him, and he told me that they were going to play Joseph Lateiner’s Di Farblondzhete Neshome2. And in the play, he said, you will play Shmuel’ikel3 and she, your wife, will play Bobele, and mark my words - it will be good!\nHe even gave me something on the spot to persuade me that it would be good - five dollars.\n– Take a fiver - he said - and it’s agreed!…\nI didn’t talk to him at all about salary. There was nothing to say, because they were playing for “stamps”4. It was just a question of what kind of stamp should be set for me. But I didn’t open my mouth to ask anything about it, because given my situation, I should stay silent and not argue with anyone about what stamp was set for me.\nAfter playing the first week in Boston, Abba Schoengold brought me a bag of money, and when I counted it and saw that it was a sum of $275, I literally couldn’t believe my eyes, and I remained sitting in a daze.\n– Schoengold, - I started speaking as if I was not sure what I wanted to say - Schoengold, maybe there is a mistake? Maybe…could it be… eh?… It is possible this was miscalculated…?\nSchoengold clearly thought that I was not satisfied and he got angry with me:\n– Oh, it’s already starting! - he grimaced - There is no error in the amount; Everything was calculated correctly, and according to the “stamp,” both you and your wife get $275 for this week. What do you want? Huh?\nAnd when he went out, he gave a wave with his hand:\n– Don’t act like such a fool!5…\nThis was the first time that I had earned so much money in one week in the Yiddish theater, and my joy was so great that, if I weren’t so ashamed of myself, I would have danced for joy.\nWhen I told my wife how much money Schoengold had given me for the first week, tears welled up in her eyes for joy, and she quietly, and with a pious expression, said, “Nu it’s really about time things looked up. And may God help so that it doesn’t get worse again later…”\nBut after the $275 in the first week, it was the same as with that poor boy who carries Purim shalach-manes6; The second week, we received less than before, and the third week - even less. And so it all went more and more downhill, and during the few weeks that fell before Pesach, it was really bad. It was difficult to make ends meet. And as usual when this happens, the actors in the troupe began to quarrel. They fought over roles, they fought over the calculations for the “stamps,” and the went around and around until there was no naches7 left to have.\nAs far as Abba Schoengold could, he did everything in his power to try and keep the peace in the troupe. But it was difficult. He was not always successful.\nAt that time, behind the curtains of the Yiddish Theater in Boston, a young man who everyone called Moishe hung around. Nobody knew his last name and nobody ever cared to know, because they saw him merely as some kind of an annoyance, a nuisance, who had ingratiated himself with the theater because he enjoyed waiting on the actors. In his submissiveness, he obeyed everyone, and whenever you had to send something somewhere, or run an errand, he was treated like the messenger boy. Behind the curtain, you’d often hear a voice from some other dressing room:\n– Moishe! Hey, Moishe!\nAnd soon you’d see Moishe running towards the voice, ready to obey, ready to serve.\nFrom then on, the young poor boy Moishe took care of everyone’s little needs. And since he was a good person by nature, no one took advantage of him or asked for anything more than was necessary.\nMoishele viewed me and my wife as if we were part of his family. Since we could not afford to keep a maid and had no one to leave our child with at home, my wife had no other choice but to take our child with her to the rehearsals and also to the performances. She kept him with her in her dressing room, and every time she had to go on stage to play a scene, she called for Moishe to come take care of the him.\nOne time, when Moishe was putting the child to sleep and sitting quietly and watching over him, an actor sent him somewhere to fetch something. The child woke up crying, and when my wife came back from the stage into her dressing room, frightened, she started shouting at the top of her voice:\n– Oi, Moishe! Where is Moishe?\nWhen he came back later and she saw him, she let out her grievances, screaming at him why he left the child alone. Just then, I too ran in frightened, and since my heart was low and I was angry with myself and the whole world, I slapped Moishe…\nSoon after I realized what I had done. But it had already happened. I could not take back the slap and poor Moishe stood in front of me dejected, offended, and I heard him say to me in the silence:\n– You don’t need to strike me, Mr. Kasten… Why should you hit me?… I’m not guilty of this…\nAnd looking at him, as he stands so pitiful and dejected, my heart was torn apart…\nYears later, the same Moishe became one of the biggest - if not the biggest - impresario in the American theater world on Broadway. He was no longer called Moishe, but Morris - Morris Gest. He was married to the daughter of the famous David Belasco, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that he, Moishe who wandered about behind the curtains of the Yiddish theater in Boston and later became Morris Gest, played a major role in the English theater in America reaching such a high artistic level; he brought the famous Moscow Art Theater, which the great Stanislavski created, to America. He also brought Max Reinhardt’s German troupe, which performed the best things in the world’s repertoire, and in general Morris Gest accomplished grandiose spectacles which are a special chapter of their own in the history of American theater.\nIt did not occur to anyone at that time that he, Moishele, the errand boy, would rise so high and occupy such a prominent place. This occurred to me less than anyone when I slapped him unjustifiably for nothing…\nBut my heart was low at the time and people could not hold me responsible for what I did in a moment of anger. The bad business in the theater upset me so much that I was always angry. And when it was clear that I couldn’t take it anymore, I left Boston and went back to Brownsville, even though I didn’t know why I was going there and what was in store for me there…\nThe only thing that attracted me to Brownsville was that it was close to New York. And New York has always drawn me to it like a magnet.",

    "text": "Like many other actors who joined the Yiddish stage in those years when you didn’t expect any great luck, I also never fell into despair when I went through bad times. I made peace with the fact that this is just how the theater profession is, and this is just what the life of an actor is: suddenly you are distinguished and it goes well and you earn enough money acting, and then all of a sudden it goes badly and you had to “put your teeth on the shelf”1, as we used to say in Ukraine, and after a while it will start to go well again.\nI never thought about leaving the stage. Not even in the worst times. Such a thought never even occurred to me, and it was difficult for me to understand those Yiddish actors who - for one reason or another - left the stage and went to something else, as was the case with Yisroel Weinblatt, Rudolph Marks, and others.\nThis kind of thing really annoyed me. I particularly resented that Rudolph Marks left the stage, because he was such a very talented actor and an excellent comedian, and in theater circles it was said that even Mogulesko quietly considers him a rival…\nIn general, I just couldn’t understand, intellectually, how an actor could leave the stage because he couldn’t have as big a name as someone else, or because he had to go through difficult times…\nSo that’s how things were when I went back to Brownsville from Boston. It was very bad for me then, and together with the comedian Frank, I managed to pull through and earn a few dollars from a performance here and there, but it wasn’t really working. Once, I mustered the courage to go to Adler, the Nesher Hagadol himself, to see if he would include me into his troupe. He actually received me well. He said that he has already heard a lot of good things about me, but he still couldn’t include me in the troupe, because it’s not up to him.\n– Talk to them - he said - with the company; If they don’t mind, I’ll let you in…\nAnd who was “the company?” The actors of the troupe. And with them there was nothing to say…\nAnd then Abba Schoengold came to my aid again, and things started to go well again.\nOf course, I drove straight away back to Boston, and there I soon saw that the leading man on the stage was not Schoengold, but Tanzman. That really wasn’t to my liking, because I got along better with Schoengold than with Tanzman. I knew that the main thing on Tanzman’s mind was that his wife the prima donna be the main attraction on the stage, and on top of that, he didn’t like when another actor performed better in a role than he did…\nBecause of his wife, Tanzman decided that in Boston we would start with an operetta, with Goldfaden’s Meilitz Yosher2 That’s what he wanted, because in this operetta his wife would have a very good role, and most of all she excelled in the song \"God’s Wonders\" which the really audience loved to hear.\nIn general, audiences back then loved Yiddish showtunes, and more than anything they loved Goldfaden’s songs, and possibly this is due to their subject matter. The songs were authentically Jewish3, and people quickly learned them and sang them everywhere.\nToday, most of these songs have been forgotten and are no longer sung, neither in theaters nor at home. And that’s why I think it’s necessary to mention them, and that’s really what I’m doing in writing about my life at the Yiddish theater. It is really worthwhile to remember those Yiddish songs of yesteryear - songs that were sung on the Yiddish stage and in hundreds of thousands of Jewish homes all over the world. I will also do the same, then, with the song \"God’s Wonders\" from Goldfaden’s operetta Meilitz Yosher, which was so beloved by audiences, and so I implore those who still remember the song to read it and sing the song to yourself, and you will certainly enjoy it very much.\nSo let’s all sing it together4:\nThat is what the prima donna sang, and soon the whole chorus sang along with the last line:\nAnd you had to see how the audience gaped when the prima donna sang it. It was a joy. The song warmed the soul. And the prima donna then sang:\nAnd then the chorus sang along in the refrain again, and the prima donna sang on. And what she sang was, just like before, a chapter of Jewish history which has been remembered since the times when the chumash7 was studied in cheder with Rashi - a chapter of Jewish history in song:\nIn this way, the story of the manna in the desert, where Moishe Rabbeinu8 led the Jews of Egypt back to the land of Canaan, was translated into song. And when the prima donna saw how the faces of all the Jews sitting in the theater lit up with joy, she added even more fire to the refrain:\nEveryone knew what was coming next, and they were very, very anxious to hear it. It appealed to the heart. It spoke to the soul. They licked their fingers and delighted in it.\nNu, let’s sing together again:\nHere, not only the chorus, but also the crowd joined in to sing refrain, and the entire theater was brightened by the joyful song. And after that came the moral of the song:\nThus went Goldfaden’s song \"God’s Wonders\" in this historical operetta, which he called Meilitz Yosher, oder Rabbi Yoselman. And no one should have any complaints for me because I have given the whole song here, from beginning to end9. I simply could not resist the temptation and I had to convey it here in its entirety, because while writing it I was singing it to myself, and I felt that I had to sing it the the whole way through. And I’m sure that those who still remember this song will also sing it to themselves when they read it, and they will be pleased that I reminded them of a beautiful old Yiddish song, that was once sung on stages everywhere that Yiddish theater was played and also in thousands and thousands of Jewish homes all over the world…",

    "text": "In the operetta Meilitz Yosher that we were playing in Boston, the character I played was sent to prison and put in shackles, and from there I sang the song \"The Moral\".\nSinging alone was not enough for me, so on top of that I also - of my own accord - did a dance after as well, and I danced in the chains, and this was a big hit with the audience, and I therefore received a lot of applause at each performance.\nThe audience was just simply pleased when I danced in chains…\nTanzman also played the same role; we were both offered the same role in Meilitz Yosher. And since Tanzman could not dance at all, he he did not excel as much as I did in the role, and this made him very resentful, so he urged me not to dance in the role either.\n– What is this dancing right in the middle of the scene? - he scolded me. - There’s no need to dance. No one is expecting you to dance!…\nBut I was firm and obstinate:\n– It will do you no good, even if you stand on the roof3; I can dance, so I dance. If you could dance, you would certainly dance too…\nWe often fought over this and Abba Schoengold always had to work to make peace between us. And when the operetta Meilitz Yosher was taken down from the stage and we started playing other pieces, the business in Boston did not go so well. Then Madame Keni Liptzin4 was brought down from New York to rescue the situation. She appeared in Der Boyeri Tremp5, in Di Farblondzhete Neshome6, and Ruchl un Leah, and that did help a little, but really only a little, not much. Soon it became bad again and we couldn’t pull through. It just wasn’t working.\nIn those times, Morris Winchevsky published a weekly newspaper called Der Emes7. He was the editor of the newspaper. And I remember once, when right before they raised the curtains for some piece whose name I no longer remember, we were informed that Winchevsky himself was coming to the performance. Abba Schoengold announced that today we should “play in such a way that there should be smoke.”\nWe all wanted to impress Winchevsky with our acting, and because of that we really applied ourselves and tried hard. And as it seems, he was very pleased with us; The best proof of this was what he later wrote about us in Der Emes, and in this article he also wrote good things about me, that I am a talented comedian and that audience found my acting to be very strong8\nWhat Winchevsky wrote about us really encouraged us. We were all very excited by it. But it didn’t bring large crowds to the theater. There was never any income. And when we saw that it was bad, we left Boston and went to Baltimore, and there Abba Schoengold was in charge again, not Tanzman. He appeared in Jacob Gordin’s Der Yidisher Kenig Lir and also in Der Kroynprints fun Yerusholayim9, and it went so well that it had never been better.\nSchoengold was in seventh heaven, and as his manner was always, he spent money liberally. In the restaurants where he ate, you knew that no matter how much food was brought to the table, it was never enough and he wanted more and more…\nThere was seldom a performance that the theater where we played wasn’t packed and people didn’t have to stand “head to head.” The Jewish community in Baltimore then really “ate Yiddish theater with bread”10, so we didn’t think at all about traveling to another city. We were sure that we would even play there not only for one season, but maybe for several seasons, and we already had all the plans for this. Abba Schoengold saw to it that people in New York knew about it and that all the famous actors there would spread the word so that they would once and for all have to admit that we, those who play in the provinces, are not insignificant or weak, and we could also “conquer a world.”\nIt was really good for us then, and we were happy that we took Baltimore “by storm.”\nEven to this day, I am stricken with terror when I remember that great disaster that happened in Baltimore. I can’t forget any of it! The crying, the voices, and the screams are still ringing in my ears, and I can now see before my eyes the terrible scene before us when we saw all the deceased. It pained the heart to look at the victims, who fell dead when they came to the theater for a little bit of enjoyment. And even though none of us was guilty of this, we still walked around feeling like killers. We were ashamed to show our faces.\nI was not performing that evening, but I instead was manning the box office. Amid the chaos, I succeeded in saving all the money that we had taken in, and I brought it to Tanzman, because he was one of our managers12.\nWhen it came time to distribute the money according to the “stamps,” Tanzman brought it up without any sense of injustice or trouble, which was really inappropriate and I couldn’t believe it at all. And in the end, I left the troupe and I didn’t know what would happen tomorrow or what kind of city I would head towards next.\nAll the newspapers in the country wrote about the calamity in the Baltimore Yiddish theater that left 22 people dead13. And when people began to look for ways to do something for the poor families of those who died, the famous English actors of the American stage came together, and it was decided that together they should give a special performance in one of the largest theaters in Baltimore, and all the proceeds should go to them, to the poor families of the deceased14.\nThat performance, I remember, was really a big event15. And if my memory serves me well, the famous American actor Richard Mansfield and the English actor Henry Irving participated in the performance.\nAfter that, I left for Philadelphia with my wife. In other words, we went back home, because my family as well as hers lived there. But back home, we had nothing to do, so I departed for New York to seek some luck. I thought now that Winchevsky himself had already written about me in a newspaper, and after I had already played in many states with success, some troupe would certainly snatch me up in New York. But no one did, and so we settled again in Brownsville.\nWhen I saw that the money I had earned in Baltimore would soon be gone, and we’d again have to “throw our teeth on the shelf” and be “swollen in the mouth”16, as they used to say in Ukraine when things got bad, together with the comedian Jacob Frank and the dramatic performer Jakele Cone17, I put together a troupe, and we went out again to play Yiddish theater in the provinces.\nAnd Jakele Cone, the ever-optimist, who could in the worst of times immediately figure out how to get out of a difficult situation, assured us that it will be good.\n–Chevreh18 - he said with a very serious face as was his usual manner - chevreh, you should not worry at all; rely on me and you will see that it will be alright.\nAnd I must say that listening to him, it really felt that we could rely on him…",

    "text": "Together with Frank and with Jakele Cone, I schlepped around the provinces and it was, as they say, all ups and downs - here it was good and there it was bad, and it turned out like in Pharaoh’s dream: The seven lean cows ate the seven fat cows, and you were always twisting your head wondering what would come next.\nOften it was like this - we would arrive in a city just when, only a few days earlier, another wandering troupe had just departed, and they had already “skimmed the top off” so there was nothing left for us. Sometimes, we would meet another wandering Yiddish troupe who was playing the same plays that we had chosen to play.\nIn general, there was terrible and fearful confusion; People tripped over each other’s feet, bumped into each other’s heads, and everyone got in one another’s way.\nIn many cities, Jakele Cone displayed his resourcefulness to get us out of an unpleasant situation. On a regular basis, an ingenious idea would strike him, and it was really something astonishing. The main thing was - as bad as it got, he didn’t give up and always encouraged us. Even when he himself had “no yontif’dike in his heart”2, he nonetheless was still able to pass the time reading Shakespeare’s Halmet for the umpteenth time, always exclaiming with enthusiasm:\n– I say, chevreh, this is a play - a rare thing in this world!\nHe was always reading plays, printed and also hand-written. And he had a such good memory, that it was enough for him to just see a play on the stage once or twice, and he already had memorized it…\nOn top of this, he always dressed very nicely and elegantly, and I liked that very much about him, because I always liked to dress nicely and elegantly. Jakele Cone always behaved like a real cavalier who really attracted the ladies…\nWhile wandering from city to city, we never arrived anywhere prepared; No one expected us anywhere and no one was eagerly awaiting our arrival. We just wandered, in demand or not. Sometimes you found yourself in a good spot, or sometimes you didn’t and it was bad, and in those times it was really miserable and gloomy. And once, when we arrived in Cleveland, we were straight away given some good news - the troupe of Abba Schoengold and Mr. and Mrs. Tanzman was already playing here - the same troupe that I left after fighting with Tanzman in Baltimore.\nI mention this, because from what I am going to tell you, you will be able to get a sense of the atmosphere that then reigned in our theater circles. All in all it was very characteristic of all the chaos of that era.\nIt was necessary that one of us meet with Tanzman and talk with him about what could be done so that we could also make something out of being in Cleveland, and so that we could at least continue to cover our expenses. And it was decided that Frank should to go to Tanzman. I could not go to Tanzman because we had fought.\nSo Frank went to him and he didn’t come back…\nHe stayed with Tanzman’s troupe and and played with them there, and where were left with nowhere to turn, so Jakele Cone also left. I was left alone and exposed, and there was nothing I could do.\nThat’s how Tanzman got even with me for the fight we had had before in Baltimore. He could not forget about it, and he could not let go of his anger towards me until he got his revenge.\nIn general, Yiddish actors in the troupes at that time fought a little too much, not only about income and about roles, but also about various other kinds of things; Morale was very low, and when an actor had a jealous wife, or an actress had a jealous husband, tempestuous and boisterous scenes often played out, and everyone had something to talk about and someone to gossip about; Everyone was talking about some kind of episode, and it was nothing new for someone to steal another’s wife or husband. And when such a thing happened, the whole troupe was thrown into such a tumult over it, and they all cast the blame at one another sins at each other, and it was such a mess…\nIt was no wonder it was like this. After all, actors are no more than real people, with all their virtues and with all their flaws, and God knows that everyone, in all circles, had to deal with these sort of things. But when something like this happened between actors, it was always a different story, because actors were a close-knit circle, and the “highly respected audience” always had their eyes on them - not only when they were on stage, but also in life. People always saw the life of an actor as though it were a mirror, and whenever something happened to him, even when it was a personal matter3, people would straight away shout it from the root tops and talk about it everywhere, in all the circles where people delighted in gossip and slander…\nIn telling this, I am not trying to tell about the not-so-noble morality that prevailed among actors in those times. I just wanted to mention it as one of the reasons that, many times, fights became so bad that troupes split into two. Then they would compete with each other, and people were ready to draw daggers.\nOn this topic alone, people could really tell a lot of very interesting things, but it is better to talk about it less than one could, and apart from this I believe that I am not the kind of man who speaks ill of others4…\nMany of the things that people did in those times now seem foolish, when you come to old age and take stock of your life that has gone by. And who knows5? Maybe if a miracle happened and you became young again, you might do the same foolish things all over again, even if you had the full awareness that all those things are mere foolishness and aren’t worth all the fuss that people make them out to be…\nBut I don’t want to get too philosophical here, so I will get back to talking about my time in Cleveland:\nFrom what I heard about what was going on in their troupe, it was clear that Schoengold and Tanzman could not the keep peace in the troupe. People were fighting over roles and also about the fact that Tanzman wanted his wife the prima donna to be featured more than everyone else in every play they performed.\nHe was always anxious about his wife. No matter how much he did for her in the theater, it always seemed to him that it still wasn’t enough and that he had to do more and more for her. He loved her very much, even though you could hardly say that she was beautiful. He was always under the illusion that everyone was going to fall in love with her, and he was full of fear that she would not stay with him. And in the end, she actually was taken away from him, and it completely ruined his life.\nAbba Schoengold could not tolerate that Tanzman was spinning things so that his wife would be more prominent than all the others in the troupe. Schoengold wanted to be featured too, and he was sure that it would be better for business in the theater, because he had a bigger name and was more popular with the audience. And they fought over this for so long, until Abba Schoengold became angry and left the troupe completely.\n– He will come back to me to get me to play with him again! - fumed Schoengold. - He’ll see how well the troupe does without Schoengold!…\nHe thought of himself very highly, the actor Schoengold. He really was a very good actor, and it was a real pleasure to see him perform.\nAfter the fight with the Tanzmans, Schoengold left Cleveland for Pittsburg, and there he hastily put together a troupe and began playing. As he always thought highly of me, and on top of that he knew that I was the kind of man who you could get along with and doesn’t pick fights with everyone, he called a week later asking me to come to Pittsburgh, and there we began a totally new partnership, and it was good again.",

    "text": "As in every city, in Pittsburgh we also had a group of very voyle yidn2 who were there for us and were ready to do anything for us, simply because they loved Yiddish theater and enjoyed that they could somehow be of help to the traveling Yiddish actors.\nThese voyle yidn, who in their simplicity had a lot of haimishkeit, were then in all the cities and towns of America, and Abba Schoengold was able to find them everywhere he went. And he didn’t only need them because they were well-connected and he could hitch his wagon to them to sell tickets for the show, but also because they could find some kind of home for his children and would take care of them while he was busy acting.\nAt that time, the actor Abba Schoengold became a widower3. His children were still small then. His son Joe4, who years later became a well-known actor and married Adler’s daughter Frances5, was just a little boy then. And since Abba Schoengold loved his children very much and he was extraordinarily loyal and devoted to them, he took them with him everywhere he traveled to play, and people knew that the first thing he did when he arrived somewhere in a city was find a respectable household for his children where they would be well looked after. And he usually found such a home with the help of one of those voyle yidn who loved Yiddish theater and who were always ready to help a wandering Yiddish actor out.\nIn general, those voyle yidn played an important role in the lives of the Yiddish actors, who for many years traveled the provinces playing Yiddish theater in all the cities and towns of America. If it weren’t for them, the situation of the traveling Yiddish actors of would have been much worse, not knowing who, in these cities far from home, was well-connected or how to earn a piece of bread from some performances.\nThis is indeed why I have to mention those voyle yidn. They earned it. And by the way, I want to say that there were also those among them whose love for the Yiddish theater, little by little, drove them to become “stage managers” as a kind of side income for them. You could find a lot such stage managers in many cities in those days. In Pittsburgh too we had someone who was something of a stage manager. He took care of us and took on the job of acquiring a theater and providing the necessary wardrobe for the performances. This was a side gig for him, and he already had a bit of experience in this.\nIn Pittsburgh, we played Joseph Lateiner’s piece Di Farblondzhete Neshome, and Schoengold gave me the role of Shabsai Goylem. I really enjoyed and felt elevated by this because this role had good singing and speaking parts, and you could stand out in front of the audience.\nI was a really big hit with the song \"A Chochum fun der Ma Nishtone\". The audience simply did not want to let me off the stage, and I had to sing the couplet over and over again. And that was of course not just because I sang the song so well, but also because the song was very popular in those days. Everyone knew the song, and it was sung everywhere.\nAs an experienced actor, I already knew that the more popular a song is, the more people want to hear it. Certain that even before I started the audience was already with me, I immediately became lively and cheerful, and I went out on the stage with a bang:\nLyrics.6\nAnd, with a snap of my finger and a wink of my eye:\nYou could call this a kind of “entrance;” with this I introduced myself to the audience in the role Shabsai Goylem. And soon after, as was the usual custom, in singing the song, delved into “lebensphilosophie”7, and I was pleased that the audience already knew what was coming next and that everyone already kvelled even before it came, and I sang with even more enthusiasm:\nLyrics.\nAs usual, this was a big hit with the women in the audience. They laughed loudly and applauded with great enjoyment. And I, contented, sang on:\nLyrics.\nIn general the song \"A Chochum fun der Ma Nishtone\" really hit the spot for women since it made fun of men. The song began and ended with the line “The wise son of the four questions,” and in the end came the part that everyone really looked forward to, ready to burst out laughing.\nLyrics.\nIt is hard to convey in words how this all happened in the Pittsburgh theater. Their laughter and their applause became stronger and stronger. I had to sing the last couplet over and over again. In the role of Shabsai Goylem, I was instantly beloved from just the first performance. And as I have already said in a previous chapter, in my writing I consider it necessary to share certain songs from the past - songs that brought so much joy into the hearts of thousands and thousands of Jews.\nIn that piece Di Farblondzhete Neshome, there was also a song called \"The Miracle of Purim\". A young girl who played the role of Bobele sang that song. This was a serious song, and people took it very seriously. Like most of the serious songs from the Yiddish theater of that time, it was based on the history of the Jews while also being connected to events of the end times.\nThis song is also worth sharing. It went like this:\nThis song always began with Haman Haroshe12. Joseph Lateiner’s piece Di Farblondzhete Neshome also started with this song. The young girl who played the role of Bobele in Pittsburgh sang with heart and feeling. The audience swallowed every word and gladly listened on:\nThat is how the song \"The Miracle of Purim\" went in Lateiner’s piece Di Farblondzhete Neshome. And from how the song cursed the Russian tsar, you could tell it was written during the period when Alexander the Third sat on the throne. You could tell from the meaning of the words that God should send him “where he sent his father,” Alexander the Second, who the revolutionaries killed in St. Petersburg with a bomb in the middle of the street…\nIt was very common that, in the free land of America, Jews would curse the Russian tsar on stage quite openly. Nobody was afraid to do so. And I still remember how Abba Schoengold himself took such great pleasure in hearing Bobele sing the song \"The Miracle of Purim\". This song was very pleasing to him, and he himself also excelled in the dramatic role he played in the piece. And he was very happy that the box office income in Pittsburgh was really good - thanks to this, he could do more for his children, who he loved so much…\nIt is really difficult to find such a faithful father as Abba Schoengold was.",

    "text": "In spite of all the luck and all the great success we had in Pittsburgh with Lateiner’s Di Farblondzhete Neshome, we did not become rich. And when our luck ended and we started thinking about where to go next, Abba Schoengold immediately had a plan ready:\n– We are going back to Baltimore!\nIn hearing Baltimore, I was struck with fear:\n– Baltimore? Really? How can we go there and what will we do there? The audiences there certainly still remember the disaster in the theater. No one will come to our performance.\n– They will come, they will come. - Schoengold answered me. - The audiences will hear that Abba Schoengold is here again, so they will come to the theater to see him play, trust me.\nHe was so stubborn about it that it was simply impossible to convince him otherwise. And he indeed got his way - we left for Baltimore. But this time, Schoengold did not succeed. And as though he had no obligation to me, because in those days there was never any talk in the provinces about such a thing as hiring an actor for the full season, he drove off somewhere alone and didn’t tell anyone where he was going or what prospects he had.\nAnd I, in God’s care alone, went to Buffalo. When I got there, I met Jacob Frank and Jakele Cone there again. Just like me, they also came there to “tap a wall” and see if they could play some shows there and earn a little money to be able to pay their expenses. And indeed, with the three of us together, it felt more haimlicher…\nAnd next we embarked on a journey, wandering across a series of the cities and towns, and I must say that in general we were a good trio. By this, I mean we really got used to living with each other, and even though it was often very bad for us and we didn’t know what tomorrow would bring us or where we’d end up next playing Yiddish theater, but we never lost heart. Frank and I, the two comedians of the trio made jokes about our poverty, and the serious, often dead-serious, Jakele Cone always stumbled upon another ingenious idea, and when he thought up something, he gave us the good news -\n– Chevreh, it will be good… You will see soon, that it will be good!…\nAs usual, all this good news was just fantasy, and afterwards we laughed at ourselves over it. In those days we really “laughed with the lizards”…\nSo we schlepped around for a long time until we reached Cincinnati. When we got there, all three of us together had, all in all, three and a half dollars… This was our entire worth that we had earned playing Yiddish theater in all the cities where there was an audience who would come to see us…\nIt was the beginning of winter. It was already cold outside and we were still walking around in our summer coats and we were shivering. But that didn’t bother us. With the full certainty that Cincinnati was a city where we could make money playing Yiddish theater, we stopped in a hotel, in a dirt-cheap hotel, and we felt very lucky with these arrangements…\nJakele Cone was certain he had heard somewhere that there was a Jew named Himmelfarb in Cincinnati who was one of those voyle yidn who was really in love with Yiddish theater, and on top of that he was a dear man with a golden heart. Jakele Cone had heard that whenever Yiddish actors came to him, he would help them sell tickets and also find other local Jews who would help them. He generally behaved in such a way to make wandering Yiddish actors in Cincinnati feel at home, and when the actors left, people would bid them farewell as though they were members of his own family.\nNu, we had to go see this Himmelfarb, and there we’d make arrangements so good we would no longer have to worry.\nWe had Mr. Himmelfarb’s address. We also knew that he had a “stationery store.” On our way there, Jakele Cone stopped to remind us something he had told us earlier:\n– Chevreh, we have to seem impressive… This meeting is a big one… This is very important…\nAnd here I want to emphasize on a few details which are, in my opinion, important simply because they are very characteristic of the Yiddish theater in provincial America - characteristic of the actors of those times, and also characteristic of the voyle yidn who used to help the actors who wandered around the provinces while dreaming of playing in New York.\nWhen we arrived at Mr. Himmelfarb’s store, we behaved as though were very important and talked to him just as if every word were a piece of gold…\n– Mr. Himmelfarb?\n– Yes.\n– My name is Cone, Jakele Cone, as I’m sure you’ve heard.\n– And my name is Kasten, Sam Kasten - I introduced myself.\nEven Frank, who by nature was a disheveled sort and had never been able keep up pretenses - even he, just like in a well-rehearsed role, really put on airs:\n– And my name is Frank. - He said this with a tone just like he was Rav Bar Ashi. - Jacob Frank… Of course you’ve heard of me, eh?\nNeedless to say, Mr. Himmelfarb was not taken aback by our names. He clearly had not heard of us, and he didn’t know who we were. And then Jakele Cone uttered three words, no more than three words, but with such a dramatic expression, just as if he had embarked on a really powerful and intense monologue from one of Shakespeare’s historical plays:\n– We are actors!…\nAnd when Mr. Himmelfarb heard that we were actors, his expression became very severe. Pinching his little beard with his fingers, he began to speak to us with restrained anger:\n– What does this have to do with me and what do you want from me?\nThis was a big surprise for us and really not a very pleasant one. We did not expect anything like this from this man about whom we have heard such good things about his attitude toward traveling Yiddish actors. It was like he had poured cold water on all three of us at once. His behavior really disconcerted us, even more so when we took the great trouble to tell him that we would like him to sell tickets for our performance.\nAs soon as he heard this, he went to open the door and said angrily:\n– Get out of here!… Get out of here already!…\n– But why? What have we done to you?\n– Stop speaking! - he became even more angry. - I don’t want to hear any more from you and I don’t want to know you..! Actors… Yiddish actors… there were already enough “runners”1 here without you…\nAnd suddenly he started shouting at the top of his voice:\n– I won’t be duped!… Enough! More than once I’ve paid the price, and it won’t happen again!\nIt was only then that we realized that others had tricked him before, and he was still very upset about it. When we started questioning him about who duped him, and we saw that he had no qualms about getting into a long dispute with us, Jakele Cone had an idea. He suddenly started speaking in English to Mr. Himmelfarb - he said that Mr. Himmelfarb should give us six cigars - the best ones in the store…\n– Only di best. - He firmly emphasized the words. - Vee are not uzed to cheap cigarz…\nAnd when the cigars were presented, he - with great pretense - paid for them so generously, as if money was no object. And after that he gave me a cigar and Frank a cigar. When all three of us lit our cigars and smelled the smoke like connoisseurs of fine cigars, Mr. Himmelfarb suddenly started looking at us as though he was no longer completely sure whether he really needed to drive us away and insult us like that.\n– Can you maybe prove to me somehow that you are indeed actors?\n– Bitte schön. - I said, suddenly starting to speak in German. - Bitte schön…\nAnd soon, from my pocket, I pulled out the article that Morris Winchevsky published in Der Emes2 that he had written about me, where he said that I was a talented comedian and that I was well-received by the audience. And when the Himmelfarb saw this, he read over it carefully. When he finished, he looked me up and down from head to toe, and looking at me he said:\n– Yes, Winchevsky… That’s really something - Winchevsky!… But tell me, I implore you, how do I know that you are really Sam Kasten? Maybe you’re not him at all, no offense… - He began to defend himself. - Nowadays, there are so many runners and swindlers that you can’t know who is who and what is what… Not long ago there was a group of runners here in Cincinnati who told some story that they wanted to play Yiddish theater, and what do you think happened? They took the money and they disappeared… When the audience came to see them play, they were no longer in Cincinnati…\nHe complained strongly that after the “runners” left with the money and stuck their tongue out at the audience, he could no longer show his face because he had sold tickets for the performance, and afterwards he had to return the money to the audiences out of his own pocket. He then posed a question again to us:\n– Nu, can you blame me for not trusting theater troupes anymore, who come here and tell stories that they will play Yiddish theater?…\nWe could not answer this question. We could not blame him, because we understood that he was, unfortunately, correct. And before leaving, Jakele Cone cleverly held the cigar in the corner of his mouth and said with a confident tone:\n– Listen, Mr. Himmelfarb, whether you will help us out or not, whether you will do something for us or not - we want to play Yiddish theater in Cincinnati!…\nAnd we left.\nWe did not understand where Jakele Cone took such certainty from. We thought that these were just words, all part of the pretense we had put on. But on the way back to the hotel, Jakele Cone said to us:\n– Listen, chevreh he is alright, Mr. Himmelfarb, he is. I tell you, he’s a voyle yid. Really a good one. And we have to show him that we are also alright and then you will see how good he will be to us. He will be a good friend of ours and he will help us out a lot… We must play theater in Cincinnati…\nAnd we did play. But before we got to play, we still had quite a bit to endure, but afterwards Mr. Himmelfarb really became a friend of ours and Cincinnati went up on the map of Yiddish theater in America. But that is a separate chapter of its own.",

    "text": "No one in Cincinnati wanted to help us take the first step to play Yiddish theater and earn a little money. It was as if all the voyle yidn in the city had suddenly all agreed to “blow cold,” because they had just been burned. And this really irritated us since we wanted to show that we were good people. On top of that, we had to do something about our situation because we didn’t have much to live on.\nWith the few pennies we still had, we went to look for a suitable hall where we could play at least one show. The hall we found requested merely 15 dollars for the evening.\n– We have to play here - Jakele Cone said. - Come thunder and lightning, we will give a performance here. And we’ll put on Jacob Gordin’s Der Yidishe Galech, a powerful melodrama that we will blow the audiences away with…\nBut where could we get a little money for the necessary expenses?\n– Here’s a thought! - I said. - Let’s sell our wristwatches…\n– And we’ll also need to sell our coats. - Frank replied.\nThis made us laugh because he, \"der royter\"1 as we called Frank, wore such a shabby coat that no one would have given him even three bucks for it…\nThen we sold the watches and some of our other valuables, which gave us the chance to take matters into our own hands. After we put a down payment on the hall and printed tickets, we went back to Mr. Himmelfarb with a request - indeed, the same request that we had had for him before:\n– Do us a toive, Mr. Himmelfarb, and sell tickets to our show; We already have a hall to play in and a piece to perform. You will see soon enough…\nThis time Mr. Himmelfarb did not drive us out. He listened to us calmly and peacefully, and then he said:\n– Nu, meyle2, I will take tickets from you to sell, but I will not hand over the money I collect from selling the tickets right away; You’ll get it only after you perform the play…\nApparently, he was still afraid that we would take the money and run off. And we couldn’t blame him. We told him that we didn’t think it should be any other way - we indeed get the money only after we put on the performance.\nJust then, there was another Jew in the store, and when he heard us doing business, he said that he too would take tickets to sell; And just like Mr. Himmelfarb, he too will only give us the money after first the performance, not before.\nThat Jew, by the way, was more sympathetic to us from the beginning than was Mr. Himmelfarb, who was obviously always afraid that we were going to make a fool of him. He brought in his daughter to join us, a young lady3 who had a strong desire to play theater. And as we were looking to bring in a young lady for a role in Jacob Gordin’s play Der Yidishe Galech, we gave her the opportunity to play. Afterwards, she remained an actress and made a name for herself on the Yiddish stage in the provinces, and later also in New York. She was the actress Clara Rafalo.\nAt the time, we didn’t have anything to eat besides bread and herring, and all the energy we had, we exerted to show the Jews in Cincinnati that actors aren’t “runners” or lawless delinquents, and we don’t just grab any money and run off with it…\nIt was simply our mission in life to show them this. It was as though it fell upon the three of us - Frank, Jakele Cone, and me - to rescue the honor of the Yiddish theater profession in the eyes of the Cincinnati Jews…\nThe three of us decided to perform as though the audience was full of of the greatest theater connoisseurs. And we therefore worked diligently during our rehearsals. And all-in-all, it was very difficult, because the troupe we had quickly assembled consisted of beginners, as it usually went when performing in the provinces. Frank, Jakele Cone, and I took it upon ourselves to play two roles each, and we generally divided up tasks and roles so that everything would be taken care of.\nIn no other city did we prepare for a performance the way we prepared for that performance in Cincinnati. But then just my chance, in the early morning hours of the day of the performance, it began to snow - a snow that really chilled you to the bone. When they opened the box office that evening, our eyes grew darker and darker because the number of the Jews who came to the box office to buy tickets was so small that only God could take pity on us…\nAll in all, we brought in no more than twenty dollars at the register, and we immediately had to return the wardrobe of the clothes we had borrowed for the play Der Yidishe Galech. After all, you can’t perform without it.4\nAll three of us then felt miserable in our hearts, very miserable. Every time we came into the theater, which could seat up to 500 people, we saw how people sat here and there amid an emptiness that really stung the eyes. We felt a kind of pain that cannot be expressed in words…\nAnd just then we also saw that the two Jews who had taken tickets to sell for us - Mr. Himmelfarb and the father of Clara Rafalo - were standing by a door and whispering to one another, the whole time looking at us without looking away…\nApparently, they thought that by now we would run off - that we would take the little money that was brought in at the cash register and we would disappear, just like those “runners” who had brought shame on our people5.\nYou could tell that’s what they were thinking from what Mr. Himmelfarb told us very openly:\n– I sold around $70 worth of tickets - he told us, - and he too - he pointed to the father of Clara Rafalo - sold around $30 worth of tickets. All in all, we have about $100 for you. But I am, you understand me, a Jew of my word, and as I have already told you, I will not put any money in your hand until I am really sure that you will actually perform, and I will only be sure of this when I see you on stage…\nHe certainly meant no harm, Mr. Himmelfarb, who loved Yiddish theater very much; But he couldn’t forget that he had already paid dearly for putting his trust in the traveling Yiddish actors who played in the provinces. I remember how Frank, the comedian, suddenly became very serious - so serious that the whole expression on his face suddenly changed. And after the two Jews left, he said to us:\n– Listen, children: Even if the world turns upside down, today we play theater, and indeed in such a way that they will never forget!…\nAs bad as the weather was outside, a crowd gradually arrived. Those who had already bought tickets from the two Jews showed up. And when we saw that there was already a crowd in the theater and that we couldn’t wait any longer, because nobody else was showing up anyways, we got dressed for the roles, and that’s it. We were so shaken and rattled that we hardly spoke to each other. And more on edge than all of us was Jakele Cone; He was pensive, serious, sullen - he was completely absorbed in himself. And when he finished dressing for the first role he had in the play, he came up to me and Frank and said:\n– Listen, chevreh, if he, Mr. Himmelfarb, wants to give us the money for the tickets after the first act - don’t take it!… We have time until after the performance. But remember what I’m telling you and follow me - don’t take it!… But really, not even a penny, before the performance is over…\nAnd Jakele Cone didn’t forget to mention one more thing:\n– If he, Mr. Himmelfarb, tries to talk to us behind the scenes between the acts, tell him we are very busy and we have no time to talk to him…\nAnd so it actually was. When Mr. Himmelfarb wanted to give us the money after the first act, we would not take it. We told him that an agreement is an agreement, a word is a word, and that we therefore do not want to take the money before the performance is over. And when he tried to say something to us, we nearly pushed him away:\n– Leave us alone, we are busy now and we don’t have time to talk to you…\nAnd the Jew shrugged6 his shoulders and he gaped…\nHe gaped not only because this, but also because of how we performed. He really liked us. And when he gave us the money after the performance, you could see that he felt like he owed us something. And a day later, he invited us to his home, and there he celebrated us in honor of the whole simche. And he himself, the “boss” who really loved Yiddish theater, always reminded us of what he said to us immediately after the performance:\n– Now we won’t let you go that easily…\nHe asked us if we could play Jacob Gordin’s piece Der Yidisher Kenig Lir, and when we answered him that it was one of our favorites, he was very excited, and after we put on Der Yidisher Kenig Lir, he treated us with great deference. And when he invited us over again for a visit, he said that now he has big plans for us and we should completely rely on him.\nAnd we relied on him, because we really saw that you could rely on such a mentsh as Mr. Himmelfarb…\nAnd Jakele Cone was triumphant:\n– Nu, chevreh, - he said, - you see now that I was right, eh?\nHe was very pleased about it all, because he knew right from the beginning how to deal with Mr. Himmelfarb, who wanted to drive us out at the first meeting with him. He was really pleased to not have been mistaken about it. And then, in a calm mood, he read Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” for the umpteenth time. He read it lying stretched out on the sofa, and while reading it he sometimes gave a shout:\n– Oi, I’m telling you chevreh, this is a play! There aren’t a lot of plays like this in the world…",

    "text": "Mr. Himmelfarb’s plan was comprised of this - he had established a club in Cincinnati into which he brought all the voyle yidn who truly loved the Yiddish theater with all their hearts. He made them members of the club: Everyone paid a certain amount, officials were elected, and meetings were held. It was decided that we would put on what the audience - meaning, the members of the club - asked us to.\n– You understand, - Mr. Himmelfarb said to us, - here in Cincinnati, we love historical plays. Nu, we want your first performance to be Bar Kochba. Can you play Bar Kochba?\nWe didn’t need to think for a long time about how to answer. Our answer was very short:\n– Nu, of course we can play Bar Kochba. What can’t we play?…\nIt was really touching to see how the Jewish community in Cincinnati yearned for historical operettas like Goldfaden’s. So touching that, even if we didn’t know Bar Kochba, or all of Goldfaden’s other historical operettas that we would later perform there, we would not have had the heart to refuse to them.\nAnd you should have seen what joy there was in Cincinnati at our first performance of Bar Kochba!\nAll the Jews of Cincinnati who came to see us perform Abraham Goldfaden’s hysterical operetta carried themselves with a poise that felt closer times of Bar Kochba than to the times in which they lived. And when it came to the song \"Lament of Zion’s daughters\"1, there was no need for a choir at all, because almost everyone in the theater sang with us. You only had to start the song, and soon everyone sang along:\nThe audience nodded along while singing. And they nodded along even more when we reached the part of the song about the churbn3 of Jerusalem.\nAnd then again, louder than before:\nThe audience especially loved when we got to the song \"A Pastechl\"4! They didn’t necessarily sing along all together, but they all sung the song with us in their hearts, and they lapped up every word and delighted in it:\nAnd here people would sing along with this beautiful and lively tune. As everyone knew:\nThat’s how the song went in the form of a little tale, a story told in rhyme. And as it proceeded, people listened closely to the story. People could listen to it over and over, because how could they not - it was, after all, so beautiful and full of charm! They really implored us to sing it again:\nWe had to play Bar Kochba several times in Cincinnati, and whenever we played this Goldfaden historical operetta, a large audience came. We also often played Shulamith, as well as other historical operettas. There was no need to worry about income at the cash register, because the members of the club that Mr. Himmelfarb established worked like bees; They sold tickets, they distributed leaflets, and in general they did everything in their power to make our performances a success. And that’s how Cincinnati became a good city for Yiddish theater, and during that time, there wasn’t a single Jewish household where songs from the historical Jewish operettas were not sung.\nThe members of the club treated all three of us - Frank, Jakele Cone, and I - with the greatest deference, and they were ready to do anything in the world for us. Whatever we wanted, they did it. Nothing was too difficult for them to do to satisfy us. And they also did a lot for us, because we had agreed that, whatever kind of play they wanted to see, we would play it for them. Everything was, as we say in the theater dialect7 - “at the request of the highly esteemed public.”\nI remember how once Mr. Himmelfarb said to us, that the public requests that we play Blimele8… They wanted to see Blimele because they had heard a lot about it, and they wanted to know if we were familiar with the play Blimele.\nWhen we heard this, we were faced with a big dilemma because none of us had seen Blimele before, and we also didn’t have a copy of the play.\nBut Jakele Cone knew one thing - you don’t turn down Himmelfarb. So he answered right there on the spot:\n– Good! You want us to put on Blimele for you, so we will put on Blimele. Just give us a little time and everything will be alright.\nIn those times, actors in the provinces generally didn’t care much about such a thing as paying “royalties” to the playwrights; Nobody asked them for permission to put on their play, and nobody paid them. Many of the plays that were performed were printed in special little books that you could buy for a few cents. And those that were not re-printed but remained as manuscripts also passed from hand to hand. It wasn’t difficult to get a copy and put on the play when you wanted, where you wanted, and as many times as you wanted.\nYou could usually get those kinds of copies from suppliers for the New York Yiddish theaters. They used to simply rewrite each play, make several copies of it, and sell those copies to anyone who was interested in buying them. And the most skilled of them were two suppliers, who have since passed away. You could get any kind of play you wanted from you, and it didn’t cost much - for one dollar you could get a copy of a rewritten play, an old one or a new one. And if you ever paid two dollars, you were really overpaying…\nThat’s how it was in those days. For a dollar or two, you could buy a play and then you became its owner. Playwrights did not think about being paid “royalties.” It had not occurred to anyone that this was necessary, and that the true owner of the play was the playwright and not the supplier who had rewritten it.\nThis is how we got Lateiner’s piece Blimele, which was also called Graff un Yude. For one dollar, one of those two suppliers sent us a scribbled copy of the piece, and the parts of the script that we couldn’t make out, well, we wrote them ourselves. Jakele Cone tried his hand at it, and he simply wrote whatever he wanted or whatever occurred to him. We also added scenes of our own. And soon roles were assigned, rehearsals were held, and when it was ready, we performed Blimele with such a bang that everyone was very impressed.\nIt was such a hit, that when another troupe came to Cincinnati some time later and played Lateiner’s Blimele exactly as it was written, people turned their noses up and said:\n– No, that’s not it…\nWe had quite the experience playing Blimele in Cincinnati.\nAll in all, we played in Cincinnati for six months, and during those six months things were really good. And, as it usually goes with actors, we all started to dress “in vinegar and honey”9, and we bought the best diamond rings and nice gold watches, and we were able to save a little money too. And our imaginations started running wild about how it will go later, and we really thought that we would conquer the world.\nBut there’s no telling where the imagination leads you, an ordinary person, especially an actor…",

    "text": "During the 6 months that we played in Cincinnati and things went well for us, I corresponded from time to time with my old friend Max Karp, and I made him an offer to come to Cincinnati and perform with us.\nI thought that it would be good if he joined us. In the letters that I wrote to him, I always mentioned that he wouldn’t need to worry about his children, who he always brought with him, at all because it was more than certain that here with us in Cincinnati, he would definitely find a nice respectable family to take good care of them. The children would feel as though it was their home, and it wouldn’t cost him a lot.\nBut Karp was always busy traveling all around other cities. It seemed he had no desire to come to us, and when, finally, he did come, it was already getting towards the end of our time in Cincinnati, and things were not going so well for us. Karp immediately took a dislike to Cincinnati and on all the voyle yidn around us, and he insisted that we go with him to Louisville, Kentucky.\n– Why have you become so sullen about Cincinnati? - he scowled. - Cincinneti, Cincinn-shmeti… Now, Louisville, Kentucky - that is a city!…\nAnd so we left and went to Louisville, and there we put on several performances, and then something I didn’t expect at all happened…\nJust when were playing in Louisville, Tanzman arrived there with his troupe. Nu, as you might expect, competition between us started right away, but that didn’t stop the actors and actresses in both troupes from meeting up and spending time with each other. And it ended with someone from our troupe having an affair with one of Tanzman’s sisters, and she joined into our troupe. We all became close pals with each other, but in the end they all went off together to play in another city and I was left behind, just as if I was a spare part…\nSchoengold even tried to stand up for me. But interceding for my wife and I did not help, because the actor’s love affair with Tanzman’s sister - who, by the way, was really quite beautiful - created a situation where the troupe didn’t need me and my wife any longer, and on top of that, there were the usual series of intrigues and reminders of old feuds, so I could no longer be in the troupe.\nAll these things are very characteristic of the chaos that prevailed in our Yiddish theater world in those days. Nobody had contracts, nobody owed each other anything, you were always subject to the whims of this and that, and it was fairly common that, over some affair that lasted no longer than the Fast of Esther at Purim2, a troupe would go through complete upheaval and completely abandon some actors, who would get left behind…\nI really resented that I was treated that way. I felt sorry for myself that I had to part with such good friends as Abba Schoengold, Jacob Frank, and Jakele Cone. But I had no other choice, so my wife and I went back to our family in Philadelphia, the same city where I settled after I arrived in America with a lot of high hopes. We lived off the money we had saved from the good times we had had in Cincinnati, we started preparing and I hoped that I would not go around empty for a long time.\nAt that time I was already a father of two children. We had a son and a daughter3. And when week after week went by and I still had nothing to show for myself, I became very restless. I must have been restless, because the little sum of money I had saved up in Cincinnati was growing smaller and smaller. It had already “run dry,” as we used to say. I left for New York. Confident that by now people would have heard a lot about me and certainly about the great success I had had in Cincinnati, I went to Thomashefsky, and also to Adler, and asked them to hire me.\nBoth of them - Thomashefsky and Adler - had indeed heard a lot about me. They knew about the success I had in Cincinnati, because I made sure that they would know about it. Even so, they were not greatly impressed by it; they received me well and complimented me, but they did not hire me.\nComing back from New York with nothing didn’t suit me at all. I just hung around like this for a while until I heard that my old friend Jacob Frank, \"der royter\"4 as we called him, had also lost his job; He too was pushed out of the troupe over the series of intrigues related to the affair which I mentioned earlier…\nWhen I heard this I was very glad, because he, \"der royter\", had always stood by me throughout times of hardship. Whenever I was left behind, we always teamed up, and we set off to find our luck in the provinces…\nHe was always ready to travel, and with him you could act in plays, in sketches, or just fill an evening singing songs of all kinds.\nFrank could do anything. He was indeed a good comedian, and there is no doubt in my mind that if he weren’t so negligent and if he had only had more ambition and the desire to work on himself, he would have occupied a more prominent place on our Yiddish stage.\nTogether with Frank, I left for Cleveland, our wives also joined us. Soon we had a troupe, and we played Joseph Lateiner’s historical operetta called Kiddush Hashem, oder Der Yidisher Minister - a play named with an “or,” as was the style in those days…\nWithout an “or,” a writer at that time couldn’t make any headlines. And if there was not an “or” in the name of a play, because the writer thought that it was unnecessary, the director of the theater provided one himself…\nAt that time, we brought the actor Sigmond Weintraub and his wife, the talented actress Rivke Weintraub, down to Cleveland, and we really hit the jackpot with both of them in our small troupe; Weintraub was not only of those actors who was honest in his acting, but also of those people who was honest in his relationships. In addition, he was intelligent, he understood people, he knew how to get along with them, and on top of all his virtues, he always came up with a way to get out of a tricky situation when we needed to work out a new plan.\nTogether with the Weintraubs, we played in Cleveland for a little while. After that, we traveled around other cities. Like gypsies, we schlepped around to the ends of the land. And when later, as it usually happened, people started to quarrel over some foolishness, I left the troupe. Tanzman let me know that he no longer had a problem with me and that he was ready to let me join, so he invited me to come to him in St. Louis, where he was stationed with a troupe…\nDropping out of a troupe, or joining a troupe in such a manner, was nothing new. Just like actors schlepped around like gypsies, they also fought like gypsies and then reconciled. And when they reconciled, you still couldn’t know how long they would last together, because at any moment someone could easily be out of the troupe - the whole troupe could easily fall apart, and there wouldn’t be anyone left…\n​​In St. Louis, Tanzman handled himself with skill. When business was not so good, he would bring down a star from New York. I remember how once he brought down Madame Keni Liptzin - not alone, but together with the famous dramatist Jacob Gordin.\nMadame Liptzin performed in two plays in St. Louis - Grillparzer’s Medea, which Gordin translated into Yiddish, and in Mirele Efros, which he wrote specifically for her. In the play Mirele Efros, I was given the role of younger son Daniel, who the actor Samuel Tobias (Tabatshnikov)5 played when the piece was first staged in New York. Tobias’s name was famous in the Yiddish theater world; he was considered a good actor and a good singer, so I was therefore terrified when I was assigned to play his role, and even moreso in a performance that Jacob Gordin himself would be at. That’s why I really girded myself when I played the role; I really wanted my acting to stand out to the famous dramatist, who made such an impression with his beautiful beard and his poise that all the actors simply trembled before him and had the greatest respect for him. And I was really very pleased when, after the performance, I heard him say to Madame Liptzin in Russian, that “Kasten, who played the young boy Daniel, was very good in the role”…\nI feel such high esteem and joy and when I heard this from his own mouth, and I boasted about it to everyone.\nAnd here I want to pass along something that is really worth sharing, because there is a good moral to this story:\nThis was on a Saturday night, after a performance of Mirele Efros. The audience in the theater then gave Gordin an ovation, and he went up on the stage and bowed, and the theater simply lit up with applause. And all of us, the actors on the stage, felt small amid his greatness…\nAfter the applause died down and the curtain was lowered after the last act, Gordin said that he was interested in going to a Turkish bath…\nHe asked who wanted to go with him in the Turkish bath, and needless to say, the actors immediately expressed their interest in joining. That was really something - to have the honor of going with Jacob Gordin himself, with the great Yiddish dramatist, to a Turkish bath!…\nI was one of the actors who joined him. When we went with him to the Turkish bath, we behaved in a very dignified and serious way, and we approached him like yeshiva students to their teacher. None of us dared utter a word that might be unbecoming to say in front of such a great and famous man…\nEven after we had already warmed up in the sauna and sat down in one of the rooms, wrapped in towels, we all behaved very seriously. Even just wearing towels, we still behaved seriously.\nAnd suddenly, to everyone’s surprise, he, Jacob Gordin himself, started telling jokes…\nHe told us one joke after another until he moved on to completely cynical jokes…\nAnd when we heard that, we simply couldn’t believe our ears and we glanced around at each other…\n– Wh-a-a-t? Him too…?\nIf we hadn’t heard it ourselves, we would have found it difficult to believe such a thing…\nAnd I have to say that after that, we looked at him with completely different eyes, and we started to lose the respect we had had for him before…",

    "text": "Among the cities where I performed Yiddish theater in those times when I schlepped all over America with wandering troupes, Chicago must also be mentioned. I can’t leave the city out - not only because it was hard for me until I arrived there, but also because some things happened there that are etched in my memory, and it’s worth mentioning them because they are connected with the history of Yiddish theater in America.\nIn playing in Chicago, I was no longer surprised by where life would lead me or where I would spent my days or nights. I came to Chicago to a real2 theater where a permanent troupe played, and the manager of the theater was Glickman3. Elias Glickman, a Jew who knew how to manage a theater, had a dream to create such a venue for the Yiddish stage in Chicago that people wouldn’t have to be ashamed of not being in New York.\nGlickman himself once also dreamed of becoming an actor. In his younger years when he still lived in the city of Zhitomir, he had participated in Russian, Ukrainian, and also Yiddish performances. When he came to America, he played on the stage too, and he loved it so much that even when he was given the lowly role of an extra, he was satisfied. However, he soon realized that he was more suited to the business side of the theater than to acting on the stage. As he was not lacking in such skills and had made money in business, he became a theater manager in Chicago. He conducted business such that it was understood that when he hired an actor, they would no longer have to wrack their brain over where to find an income because he took care of them.\nAt first, Glickman hired my wife. Apparently, he didn’t have any desire to engage me then, or he didn’t need me. But a few weeks later he sent for me, and when I arrived, he advertised me very well. In a short time I became one of the pillars in the troupe. I appeared in prominent roles, and he was very satisfied with me.\nIn general, I was able to get along with people wherever I went; I was never one of those people who started fights. I could, and I still can, swallow a lot of things that weren’t worth making a fuss over. I only got angry when people insulted me for no reason…\nAt Glickman’s theater in Chicago, I also got along well with the troupe, and I was satisfied that I didn’t have to schlep around like before. And no matter how much my wife and I earned, it was enough for us, and we were happy with the fact that we had such precious children.\nWith this, I don’t intend to present myself in such a light that you’d think I was a homebody or that I was a paragon of serious or dignified behavior. No, I wouldn’t say that. I confess, when I was making a good living, I liked to go out with friends and acquaintances and have a good time. I usually did not refuse a good glass of wine and a good bit of liquor, and I knew how to live it up4 so that no one I went out with would be sad…\nThat’s the kind of person I was. But I still knew “where one and how finished”5. And I have always loved my family, and my wife and children have always been very dear to me. I mention this just because it just came to mind while writing. And now I will continue to tell you about the times when I played at Glickman’s in Chicago.\nAs an experienced theater director, Glickman maintained that it was necessary to always have something new to attract the audience as much as possible. Because of this, from time to time, he would bring an actor with a big name to Chicago from New York. And when he once heard that there was a big fuss in New York over the opera singer Max Medvedev, who came from Russia to America and was performing on the Yiddish stage, he didn’t think twice about it, and he brought him to Chicago.\nMedvedev was never much of an actor. He was merely a good singer, and in his younger years he excelled with his singing. But when he was brought to America, his voice wasn’t the same as it used to be, and when people heard him sing, they were disappointed…\nBut it was still a bit of a sensation. People talked a lot about an opera singer stepping out onto the Yiddish stage to perform alongside all the other Jewish actors in the play. That alone was a sensation, because people had heard a lot about Medvedev before. And indeed that is why Glickman brought him down to Chicago.\nBecause of him Medvedev, in Chicago we put on a piece that bore the same the name of the famous opera Zhydovka6, and in it Medvedev sang the famous aria in Russian \"Rachil, ti Dotsch Moya\"7.\nHe sang it beautifully. His voice sounded strong. But the performances put on with him did not have any great success, and they did not warm up the audience. The whole story of playing Yiddish theater with an opera singer who spoke chozti-goyishe8 Yiddish and sings arias in Russian did not appeal to audiences, and they were not enthusiastic about it…\nIt didn’t stick.\nMedvedev himself did not feel at home on the Yiddish stage. He also felt like a stranger among the Yiddish actors. That’s how it seemed. And I remember how at the first performance, when Medvedev was sitting by himself in the dressing room between scenes, pensive and apprehensive, I went to him and started speaking in my broken and stilted Russian, of which a little still remained in my memory. And when I told him that my name back home was not Kasten, but Konstantinovsky and that I once went to a cheder in the shtetl Rybinka, he was startled:\n– In Rybinka?!… – Yes, in Rybinka!\nAnd then I reminded him of the time when he was whipped in the besmedresh9. When he heard this, he loudly burst into laughter, and when he was done with his good laugh, a deep sadness suddenly spread across his face, and he said:\n– Yes, those were the days… I was still young then… and everything was ahead of me… not like now… now everything is behind me… in the past…\nThis is how the fallen Russian opera singer Medvedev spoke. And when he said this, I saw him before me as he once was - Meïr the synagogue choirboy, the son of the Rokinta Rabbi and the brother of the Rybinka butcher Yehiel…\nA piece of the Jewish past from the two small Ukrainian shtetlech, Rokinta and Rybinka. And then suddenly Rybinka was transported here right before my eyes in the form of some strange metamorphosis on the Yiddish stage, in the city of wind and smoke - in Chicago…\nJust at that time - and this, I believe, must have been in the year 1900 - the Actors’ Union in New York called a strike at the People’s Theater10. When we, the Yiddish actors in Chicago, heard this, there was an immediate uproar. And it was no wonder - many Yiddish actors in the provinces who schlepped around like gypsies from city to city were angry because they were not part of the union, and therefore they could not show any great solidarity with the strikers. They thought that they should have the opportunity to strike too…\nOnce, when I was sitting with Medvedev in his dressing room between shows, talking with him about the shtetlech we both knew well - about Arkitne, about Rybinka, about Vasilkov, about Talne, Belaya Tserkov, and about other shtetlech - two Jews came in and told me that Thomashefsky had sent them to me. Boris Thomashefsky, of New York; They came to Chicago specifically to see me…\nAt that moment, the actor’s strike in the New York People’s Theater was completely out of my mind. I looked at the two Jews, astonished, and I asked them:\n– For what reason, tell me, I implore you, did Mr. Thomashefsky send you here to me from New York?\n– He wants you to come and play with him…\nOnly then did I suddenly realize what their intentions were. I instantly remembered the strike, and it became clear to me what they wanted - they simply wanted me to come to New York to be a scab. And I answered them very sternly:\n– Tell Thomashefsky that I said if he wants to hire me, he should choose a more appropriate time. Also tell him this - I am not a scab!\n– We’ll give you $500 right now. - one of them said. - $500 right here on the spot…\nThey thought that I would surely take it. But I answered them coldly:\n– Even if you gave me ten times as much, I still wouldn’t go…\nWhile the conversation was going on between me and the two Jews, whose names I don’t want to mention here, Medvedev sat with a sullen expression, measuring the two Jews up from head to toe. And suddenly he put his hand on my knee and started speaking in Russian:\n– Take the $500 from them… take it and send the money to the strikers!…\nHe was sure that the two Jews did not understand Russian. But in fact they did understand Russian, and they got angry at him.\n– What a fool… He wants us to give the money away for nothing…\nNeedless to say, I didn’t go to New York to play at that time. But in the troupe there were some actors who did go to New York to play, and they tried to justify it by saying that they don’t want to join the union…\nThere is an excuse for everything. Even for being a scab…\nBut I will not give the names of those actors. It’s better not to mention this…",

    "text": "The strike that the Hebrew Actors' Union waged in New York’s People’s Theater led to a complete revolution in our little theater world. The union won the strike, and from then on the actors stopped playing for “stamps” and started receiving weekly salaries.\nWhen we heard in Chicago that the strikers at the People’s Theater in New York had won, we were very happy about it. And after we finished the season in Chicago, I left for New York. I was sure that the union would accept me very soon, because they knew how I turned down the People’s Theater offer to play during the strike.\nThat I behaved like a good union man even before I was accepted into the union should be, in my opinion, enough for them to see me as one of them, as someone who deserves to be a union member - not to mention the fact that I already had made a name as a good comedian, and people had already heard a lot about me in the Jewish circles in New York.\nAt that time, I wanted very much to be admitted to the union and to be able to settle in New York with my family, because I was tired, so very tired, of schlepping around the cities and towns where you never knew what would happen to you or where you would end up next. I was sick of wandering around, and I wanted to have a permanent home.\nBut they still didn’t want to admit me to the Hebrew Actors' Union. They locked their doors to me, and I remember how at that time I heard that the actor Simonoff waged a campaign - for every candidate who came to try out for the union, the vote should be - “No.”\nPeople in the theater circles joked a lot about Simonoff’s constant “No” vote for new candidates. Jokes that really made you laugh out loud. But I did not find it funny, and I left New York with a deep sorrow in my heart and settled again in Philadelphia, as I always used to do when I was eagerly on the lookout for my next steps and racking my brain about what I should do.\nFrom the experiences I had already had, I knew that I would not fail; I’d find something somewhere to earn my piece of bread. And so it was.\nBefore the summer ended1, a Jew with a big name in the Yiddish theater world came to Philadelphia, and soon it became known that he was putting together a troupe, a Yiddish troupe, who would play the whole season in Columbia Theatre2.\nThat Jew was named Ivan Abramson. He was the husband of the Yiddish actress Lisa Einhorn, who played the first Shulamith on the Yiddish stage in 1880. Ivan Abramson came from Russia, and it was said that he came to America when he was still a young man of 16 or 17 years old, and he was one of Gordin’s first followers. He loved Yiddish theater, and he had literary pretensions and had once published a humorous weekly in New York called Der Yidisher Pok3.\nIn general, Ivan was one of those people who threw money around. Whenever he took on something new, he enthusiastically talked it up as something grand, very grand. When he began to assemble the troupe in Philadelphia, he also talked about it like this - that it could really mean that soon Philadelphia could surpass New York. When he engaged me to play with him at the Columbia Theater, I was very pleased and I did not complain about the wages; It turned out that my wife and I, together, would both receive $25 a week.\nThe troupe consisted of actors who were already known. I remember that these actors played in the troupe: Joe Kessler, Elias Rothstein, Samuel Shneyer, Madame Rae Shneyer and many others. But the leading actor was Berl Bernstein, who was known as a very good comedian, and audiences loved him very much.\nIt was not easy to get along with the comedian Bernstein in a troupe because he was a very jealous man. If he ever saw that another actor was a big hit with audiences in a role, he couldn’t rest and he ate himself alive over it.\nThat’s the kind of person Bernstein was, and he couldn’t be different even if he wanted to. It could not have been pleasant for him, because it took a real toll on his health, but he couldn’t help his own nature. And in the theater circles, people called him \"Berele hop\".\nHe was given this nickname because, in every role he played, he would frolic and skip around, and it was impossible to get him to stop4. In general, he was one of those actors who usually played “solo” and was so engrossed in his own role, and it didn’t matter to him that he often took it so far, that it didn’t even make sense with plot of the piece…\nI had to put up with a lot from Bernstein in Abramson’s Philadelphia troupe, because as soon as I was selected for a role, he couldn’t stand it and he treated me with scorn….\nThe first time I swallowed everything, but after that it started to irritate me, and I looked for ways to show him that I would not be intimidated.\nOne time, when we put on Lateiner’s piece Blimele, I was asked to play the role of Zeligl, a role in which Mogulesko himself really excelled. And as always, when I only had to play a role in which Mogulesko himself excelled, I worked really hard to prepare, and this time was no exception. I studied the role of Zeligl, and above all I studied the couplet which Zeligl sang as a duet with Zirele:\nI was very familiar with all of the little charming idiosyncrasies and gestures that Mogulesko did during the song, because I had seen him many times in the role of Zeligl. I tried to imitate him as much as I could, and I was very eager to see how it would go for me on stage.\nI was really looking forward to the moment when I would appear on stage in the role of Zeligl the poet in Lateiner’s play Blimele, which was so popular with the audiences. But suddenly when the play was announced, my name was left out.\nThis really angered me, and I complained to the director Ivan Abramson:\n– What is this, not announcing me in the role of Zeligl? What, are you ashamed of me?\nJust then, when I went to Abramson, Berl Bernstein was also sitting there and he said something to me like - I shouldn’t be upset about it because I should be pleased that I got to play on the same stage with such an actor as Berl Bernstein…\nHis behavior toward me offended me, and I spoke up for myself:\n– What was that, \"Berele hop\"? I will not stand for this!\nAnd I told him angrily that he would also not be able to perform in Blimele either, because since I was not announced, I wouldn’t play the role of Zeligl at all, so the play wouldn’t be able to go on either.\nWhen Bernstein heard this, he immediately softened and started to persuade me that this omission was nothing more than an oversight. Abramson also persuaded me that no one was trying to offend me. And I forgave them and ended up I playing the role, and I was a big hit on the stage.\nBut my heart still told me that this was not an oversight, but that they were actually trying to suppress me. And afterwards I found out that I was indeed correct, as I will explain later. And I can assure you that it will be interesting, because it is related to the theater politics of those times.",

    "text": "My suspicion that it was no mere coincidence that my name was not announced for performance where I played Mogulesko’s role was not unfounded.\nYou could tell from how later, when the piece Kol Nidre1 was staged, my name was again not announced, even though I played a major role. It was clear to me that this was all because Berl Bernstein was a jealousnik, and he simply did not want my name to stand out.\nI couldn’t blame him that he wasn’t able to treat me fairly, because as I’ve already told you, it’s possible that he did not enjoy that he got so jealous of the other comedians on the Yiddish stage. Perhaps he just couldn’t help himself because that was his nature, and he just couldn’t change it…\nAnd he was not the only one who had such a nature; Such actors have always been on the Yiddish stage, even now still. You can also find many such actors on the non-Yiddish stage, too. Some show it more, and others show it less.\nMany times, I thought that the comedian Berl Bernstein suffered from this illness, and I was ready to forgive him and not hold it against him. But I myself am also an actor, and an actor, you must know, cannot remain silent when his name is not announced…\nIt hurts so much that you simply can’t be silent…\nOne time, when we were getting ready to put on Goldfaden’s historical operetta Shulamith in Abramson’s theater, they gave me the comic role of the Tsingetang, who follows Avisholem around the whole time. And I really liked to play Tsingetang and I had already worked out how to sing his disturbing little song:\nIt was explicitly promised that this time my name would not be left out, and they will specifically announce that I, the comedian Sam Kasten, will play the role of Tsingetang in Shulamith. But they didn’t keep their word; They announced that the role of Tsingetang would be played by Berl Bernstein, even though I was playing the role…\nThat’s what they decided, and when I complained, they tried to weasel out of what they did with all kinds of excuses, but this time it didn’t work.\nWhen this happened, I felt so restricted at Ivan Abramson’s theater that I could no longer stay there, and I firmly decided that I would not play the role of Tsingetang in the performance of Shulamith.\n– Let Bernstein play the role - I said angrily. - He has been announced in the role, he should play it. Not me!…\nAt that time, Mike Thomashefsky, one of Boris Thomashefsky’s younger brothers, owned and was the director of the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia. The famous actor Sigmond Feinman played there with a troupe, and he performed Jacob Gordin’s piece Gott, Mentsh, un Tayvl as well as others of the best repertoire pieces. In those times, in general - not only in Philadelphia but also in New York - they would put on the old repertoire; At the beginning of a season, people did not look for a new play, as is the case today. It started with repertoire and ended with repertoire. And no play that was popular with the audience and where the actors really had something to play was ever taken off the stage.\nThat’s how people used to behave. And there was always a crowd that gladly came to see the same play when another well-known actor played the main role. They wanted to see the difference between this actor and that actor, and afterwards they had a whole discussion and debate about it…\nI went to Feinman and he talked it over with Mike Thomashefsky, and immediately I was accepted into the troupe. They announced on stage that from now on, the comedian Sam Kasten will no longer play in the Columbia Theatre, only here in Arch Street Theater. And they gave me many opportunities to appear in good pieces from the old repertoire, and I felt good there.\nThere was fierce competition between the two Yiddish theaters in Philadelphia, and each always wanted to prevail over the other. That’s why everything was always so chaotic. Each was always trying to head the other one off. They simply tried to catch the other one with their hands tied behind their back, and as a result business in both theaters started to go very badly, and all around everyone was very unhappy.\nIn the chaos, we, the actors of the troupe, had to work very hard because no play lasted long enough to warm up the boards on the stage; Today we put on one play, and tomorrow we put on another. We were always busy with rehearsals. People were always coming up with new ideas, always looking for ways to make the best of a bad situation.\nOne time when I was wandering around backstage at a performance and waiting for my cue in some role I was playing, I heard a bell boy from a hotel ask one of the actors, “Who here is Mr. Kasten?”\nI hurried to him:\n– I am Mr. Kasten!\nThe bell boy handed me a little note and told me that I must give an answer right away, because they were waiting. And just then, as though out of spite, they called me up onto the stage for my cue, and I wasn’t able to read the letter yet…\nI was wracked with impatience, and I really wanted to know who the note was from and what it said. But I had to be patient. As soon as I finished my scene and went backstage again, I read the letter and it immediately brought joy to my heart…\nThis was a letter from Boris Thomashefsky and Yosl Edelstein, the owners of the People’s Theater in New York… They both came to Philadelphia and are now waiting for me in a hotel… They wanted to hire me to play In New York, and I should let them know, through the bell boy, whether I would come to talk it over with them when the show was over…\nI really did not expect such a thing. Who could have imagined that Boris Thomashefsky himself, together with Edelstein, would come from New York to Philadelphia specifically to hire me?…\nIt goes without saying that I immediately sent the bell boy back to them with an answer, that I will come to see them. And when I went to their hotel after the show, Boris Thomashefsky didn’t started talking to me directly about it, but danced around it a bit. But Edelstein soon interrupted got straight to the point:\n– Listen to what I will tell you - right away, as was his way, he started talking to me informally2 - We want to hire you to play in “People’s Music Hall.” How much do you want?\nHe gave no further introduction.\nHearing that they didn’t want to hire me to play in the People’s Theater, where they put on plays and where the famous Jacob P. Adler was one of the three managers, but instead in “People’s Music Hall,” where they played vaudeville, my heart got a little colder. I was not as excited as I was before, and I replied that I would agree to play in the music hall only on one condition.\n– And what is the condition? Yosele Edelstein asked, undeterred. - By all means, we’re listening…\n– The condition is, - I answered him, - that I will play in the music hall, if you agree that next season I will play in the People’s Theater…\nHearing such a thing, Boris Thomashefsky began to equivocate. He said that this is impossible because I would have to be a member of the Hebrew Actors' Union. When I suggested they could use their influence to get me admitted to the union, Edelstein said:\n– You’ll see, you’ll see, the main thing is to gird yourself and be strong, and know the right thing to say. Nu, in short, we’ll see to it that you will join the union… What then will we do with you in New York? How will we butter you up?\nWe then got around to talking about my price to play for one season in the “People’s Music Hall.” We agreed that I would receive $35 a week, and my wife would receive $15 a week. And when they asked how much I would like to receive a week to play the next season in People’s Theater with Thomashefsky and Adler, I really didn’t know how to answer. I knew that to play in People’s Theater, I couldn’t ask for more than I was getting in People’s Music Hall. 3The thing was, if I asked for the right amount of money, then the chances of earning more would be better later. So, with a considerable amount of uncertainty, I hedged:\n– Well,…How about $20 a week?\nWith this, Yosl Edelstein looked at me as though I had asked for far too much. That’s how it seemed to me. But he had something completely different in mind. He leaned his head on his shoulders, as he used to do when he had to give some kind of firm decision that he stood resolute on, he said:\n– Get out of here, you imbecile! You won’t be able make a living on $20 a week; I’ll give you $30…\nI then did not believe my own ears; This was the first time that I saw the ever-sullen Edelstein show someone genuine kindness and treat them so considerately. Later, when I got to know Edelstein better, I saw that, through his gloomy demeanor, he was really a very good person. He could do favors quietly and he never made a big deal out of it. Besides, he was a man of his word, and if he promised you something, you could rely on it. You could always count on his word.\nI then proudly told everyone that Edelstein had hired me, and when I left for New York after the season in Philadelphia, I settled there with my family. And I was sure that now that it’s finally come true, my dream to play Yiddish theater in New York, and everything would finally be good. But if course it didn’t go as well as I had imagined. A lot of great difficulties were still in store for me. Quite a lot indeed.",

This is a separate chapter all on its own, so it’s worth mentioning a few things that people have long long forgotten.\nThese music hall were very popular with the general public, and it was no wonder, because they played and sang to appeal to the crowd’s2 tastes, and quite a few songs were of the style with a lot of well-known insinuations3. The tickets were cheap, you could go whenever you wanted, you could drink as much beer as you were able, and when you weren’t totally sober, you could enjoy singing at the top of your lungs together with the actors on stage. It was lively and cheerful.\nAll in all, the atmosphere in the music halls was a blend of a pub and a theater, and the Yiddish theater had to compete with them. The theaters had to take this competition very seriously, because the public really enjoyed the music halls.\nAnd there were already a few writers who specialized in writing songs for all the music halls. For a few dollars, you could buy a little ditty from them. And the most skilled among them were none other than the excellent three men - Louis Gilrod, Itzhik Reingold and Isidore Lillian. They could have written a song about anything in the world. A lot of their songs were very sentimental, and the people who loved their songs thoroughly enjoyed them. In general, a lot of their songs were about illicit love affairs. These songs were always a big hit with audiences, who had a grand time drinking beer at their little tables. So that you can have an idea of what these kind of songs were like, I’ll give you an example of one of Itzhik Reingold’s songs, which was called “My dear yukel4, you.” It’s not worth giving the whole song, only just part of it, which told of an illicit affair:\nThere were also songs that lamented that these days were not like the days of old, and you could no longer get a “schooner beer” for a nickel. One little ditty I remember went like this:\nPeople really enjoyed these kinds of songs. They licked their fingers7 over these songs, and Yiddish actors who later earned a name for themselves on the Yiddish stage, some of whom became very famous, would perform in these odd sort of pub/theater hybrids.\nAmong those actors who played and sang in the People’s Music Hall, which was located on the Bowery, was the actress Clara Young who later became a star in the Yiddish theater world. When she, together with her husband Boaz Young, traveled all around Europe playing in operettas that were specially written for her, she made a big splash everywhere she went, and the greatest theater connoisseurs really loved her. Even in Moscow and in Saint Petersburg her performances were a big hit, and famous people who were never previously interested in Yiddish theater came to see her sang her praises.\nAlso, Charlie Cohan, Katzman, Baratz, Wexler and more who later held quite honorable places on the Yiddish stage and excelled in fine roles played together with me on the stage of the People’s Music Hall, one of the “Yiddish varieties” as they were so-called.\nLater two other lyric writers came on the scene - Meyerowitz and Smulewitz. Meyerowitz made a name for himself with his song \"Yisrolik, Kum Aheym\"8, and Smulewitz became famous with his song “A brivele der mamen”9. Both songs were sung not only in America, but everywhere in the world where Jews lived.\nThe entire atmosphere in the music halls, where sketches were performed and songs were sung, wasn’t really conducive to creating shows of substance. Even actors with talent and ambition couldn’t accomplish anything big, because everything was thrown together so hastily and because, above all, they had to entertain the audience - who more often than not were far from sober. In such an atmosphere, the audiences didn’t pay attention to talent, and those actors who really had talent had to play to the lowest common denominator.\nAnd at the beginning of the next season11 I came back to New York to play in the People’s Theater, as per our agreement.\nBut before I could begin playing in the People’s Theater, which Yosl Edelstein, Jacob P. Adler, and Boris Thomashefsky managed, I had to be admitted into the Hebrew Actors' Union, which would mean I would be a “regular actor.” And in the process of getting into the union, a funny thing happened which I can not forget, and it happened like this:\nAt the time when I played in the People’s Music Hall where I was already considered a star, I became friends with all the actors who were already in the union and played in the biggest theaters. The musician Yudele Belzer, the son of the famous Barditshever chazn Nissi Belzer, brought me into their circle. Yudele Belzer used to write the music for the songs that were sung on the Yiddish stage, and all the actors loved him very much. He was not only a good musician, but also a good brother, a mentsh with a warm heart. And because he thought very highly of me, he worked hard so that I wouldn’t have a difficult time being accepted into the union.\nA whole campaign was then launched for me to be admitted into the union, and by all accounts, it looked like it would all be good: Quietly, everyone promised that in the exam12 that I had to do for the actors in the union, they would vote “Yes” and everything would be alright.\nThere was only one actor who could not be convinced to vote “Yes,” and that actor was - Simonoff…\nHe said quite openly that he would not vote “Yes,” but instead “No,” and it wasn’t because he had a problem with me, and of course it wasn’t because I wasn’t a good actor. On the contrary, his opinion was that I was actually a good actor and on top of that a good brother too, an honest man, a dear man. But…\nBut what?\nIt was just that - he was not able to say “Yes” when someone needed to be admitted into the union…! He could not…! He must say “No”… That’s what he’s always done throughout the union’s existence, and that’s what he will always do…\nBut his heart would not allow him to vote against me. He felt that, in this case, that it would be an injustice to do this, but at the same time he was not able to vote “Yes,” because in general it wasn’t in his nature to ever vote “Yes” and it was indeed a mineg13 that he could not break. So he did not attend the meeting with the other actors…\nThat was the only way for him. There was no other way, because otherwise he would vote “No.” In other words, his heart would not allow him to vote “Yes”… He could not do anything else!\nAnd so that’s what he did. He didn’t come to the meeting where I passed the exam for the actors. And they admitted me to the union…",

    "text": "They really fumed over this and worked themselves up, and they told us that, having thoroughly discussed the whole matter, they would all come to the first performance and watch me perform the entire role, and here’s how it would go: They would let me perform the role of Naftali the Mishuganer if I played it in a new way, different from how Bernstein would play it. But if I did not play the role differently and played it just as Bernstein would, then there would be hell to pay. They would make a huge scene in the theater and pelt me with rotten apples, and they would make sure that I would have no choice but to get off the stage…\nIn hearing this, I thought - this could have been worse, and I suddenly stumbled upon an ingenious idea. The idea was that, before the curtains went up for the first show, I saw to it that the two trees which are part of the set would be well screwed to the stageboards, as strongly as possible. And when the scene came where Thomashefsky, in the role of the Crown Prince Alexander, challenged me to a sword fight, I would jump up into one of the trees. And when he came at me with his sword, I would jump to the other tree in one leap, and I would do it so cleverly that Thomashefsky would be left standing in confusion, looking around in all directions, and he’d call out:\n– You mumzer3 how did you do that…?\nJumping so quickly into one tree, and then from one tree to the other, is something Berl Bernstein could not do, because he was too heavy. But I was weighed much less - a little squirrel who could flit around, and very light on my feet. It wasn’t hard for me to pull off this little stunt. I did it like a real acrobat who was skilled at this sort of thing, and I was such a hit with Bernstein’s fans that they didn’t think about driving me off the stage anymore. I passed their test, and everything was good and fine.\nAnd that’s how I got “in” with the fans, who held an actor’s fate on the stage in their very hands. Afterwards, I performed many more plays in that theater, and a lot of those fans stuck with me and became my own admirers.\nIn those days, in most plays that were put on in the People’s Theater, Bessie Thomashefsky did not play roles of young girls or women, but instead only roles of boys or nimble young men. This was customary. And the audiences knew that Bessie Thomashefsky - an actress with true talent who God had blessed with a lot of charm - usually played in trousers4\nBut once, when we began rehearsals for some new play, they gave me the role of an agile young man, and it was a big surprise to everyone in the troupe, because they were sure that of course Bessie Thomashefsky would play this role. Boris Thomashefsky gave me the role simply because, at the time, he was mad at Bessie. Their sholem bais5 was beginning to break down, and he wanted to show her that he was the head of the household and he can do what he wants. But it wasn’t my place to interfere in such matters; they gave me a role to play, and I would play it. They gave me a song to sing in the role, and I would sing it. The politics around it didn’t concern me.\nBut after a little time passed, Thomashefsky made up with Bessie, and then straight away he gave her a role in the play - the role of the young man, as was customary for Bessie Thomashefsky to play.\nBut the real victim of this situation was the actor Louis Birnbaum; he was also cast in the role of a really lively young boy, but they took the role from him and gave it to Bessie. And then it got worse - they took my song and gave it to her too. And this really annoyed me, because I was a big hit with audiences with this song. And I really loved the song, too.\nBut what could I do? I had no real authority in the theater, and I knew that if I complained, it wouldn’t make a difference. I reasoned that nothing would change this decision, and I confess that I was really hurt by it, and I was ashamed of that. And then Edelstein, the sullen man Edelstein, learned what had happened, and he, who was usually more quiet than talkative, suddenly became vocal and he firmly said:\n– We don’t play these kind of games in my theater! I will not allow people to be insulted like this! This will not stand!…\nHis opinion was that that giving an actor a role and then taking it away to give to someone else was something only the directory of the theater should do. If the directory thought that someone else would play the role better, then he could reassign the role to them. But to take a song that is part of an actor’s role away and give it to someone else to sing - this was not acceptable!…\n– No, I say, in my theater we will not play these games! - Edelstein spoke loudly and sharply. -I will not allow people to be insulted like this!…\nAnd he saw to it that the song was given back to me, as he wanted, and I would sing it in my role just as before. Yosl Edelstein had a strong sense of justice, in his own quiet way. He kept his eye on everyone and everything. And just like he hated being deceived by those who thought they were so smart, he hated deceiving others. He marched to the beat of his own drum6. And he was no pushover. He knew what he wanted, even if he didn’t say it out loud.\nIt’s worth sharing another anecdote that is very characteristic of Edelstein’s relationship with the actors. In that season I played in People’s Theater, the great Yiddish artist Mogulesko fell ill and rumors started circulating that he would never be able to perform again. The great artist who had enchanted thousands and thousands of people had lost his voice. He couldn’t even utter a single word. He fell into a deep depression, sitting at home alone for hours on end, vacantly staring out the window at the street as people walked, preoccupied with their business or their pleasures. He heaved a sigh, and who knows what kinds of thoughts he had going around in his mind.\nVery often, when it seemed to him that he was disturbing his wife and children with his silence and his sickness, as though an evil spirit had possessed him, he would go out alone to the park. And just like he would do at home, he would sit, pensive and preoccupied. When some passerby would ask him something, he was unable to answer because he had lost his voice and could not utter even one word. He felt embarrassed, ashamed as a child who was caught doing something not nice. And this is how he - the great artist, who did not know how great he was and what a deep mark he had made on the Yiddish stage - passed the time, tormented and tortured. And in his despair, he thought that maybe it would be this way forever, that might never again play on the stage and of course everyone would forget him…\nIn those times, the most difficult of Mogulesko’s life in America, Edelstein sent him $25 every week… And he didn’t have to do anything to earn it.\nBut Mogulesko did not like being given money for nothing, so from time to time he would come to the People’s Theater, and tapping one finger on the piano, he would study the music with the actors who had to sing songs in their roles. It was heart-wrenching to watch him do this. Your heart simply ached watching it. The great Mogulesko - who could not speak even one word! The genial comedian Mogulesko - without even smile on his face!\nAnd rumors spread that he intended to play the drums and be a percussionist in the theater orchestra…\nIt was not only us, the actors, who worried about Mogulesko. Indeed, the wider Jewish community was concerned. It wasn’t anything new that a Jew would stop someone from the theater community in the street just to ask them, “How is Mogulesko?” He didn’t want to know anything else. He didn’t want to ask anything else. And when he got the answer that things were not good with Mogulesko, he would shake his head and say, “May God have mercy on him. We must pray for him.”\nThere was no other Yiddish performer that the people - the regular/“everyday” people - showed such great interest in and had such abiding love for as Mogulesko. The intelligentsia circles, where people held debates about literature and art, also showed great interest in Mogulesko, and they all wanted to know if there was any hope that he would regain his voice and be able to perform again.\nPeople were looking out for a miracle. People were waiting for it…",

    "text": "Everyone in the Mogulesko family was overjoyed. The whole family was elated. And Mogulesko himself went on and on, gaping,\n– Do you hear? Do you hear? I can talk!\nThis story was later told to me many times. Mogulesko himself used to tell it over and over. And his family as well, whenever they had the chance, would tell the story as I have told it here. And I believe, that if someone writes Mogulesko’s biography, they’ll have to dwell on and give a detailed account of this, and maybe even recount a lot of details that I haven’t mentioned here.\nAs soon as Yosl Edelstein heard that Mogulesko had regained his voice and could talk again, he immediately went over to his home. And when he came back, his scowling face shone and he was in high spirits:\n– Oh yes, it’s good, it’s good! Long live Zeligl Mogulesko! He can talk again!\nPeople didn’t come to the theater that night to see Di Imigranten - they only came to see Mogulesko in the role of “Feitl-Pavolye”. Indeed, that’s what they mostly said when they came to buy tickets for Shomer’s Di Imigranten - they said they were buying the tickets just to see Mogulesko play “Feitl-Pavolye”.\nIt was usually like that in those days - whenever Mogulesko performed, his acting caused such commotion and stirred up such enthusiasm with the audiences that nobody cared what play was being put on - they only cared that Mogulesko was appearing in it. The specific play being put on wasn’t the point, only what role Mogulesko was playing. He would often add his own artistic flair to the role. In everything he did on the stage, he was so full of charm and exuded such warmth and love that people wanted to see him perform over and over again, and each time they were just as enthusiastic as the last.\nMogulesko brought such mastery to his roles with his own unique kind of intonation, that the audiences picked it up and “sang” it everywhere they went just as you would pick up a beautiful nign that you loved to sing along to.\nEvery little word that he said in a role, or that he snuck in on his own, became very popular with the audiences. After a show, you’d hear people reciting them everywhere - in the street, at home, in the shop; It was etched in your memory and you couldn’t forget it, and when someone would merely say a word of it, you saw before you the essence of Mogulesko, and that alone was enough to make your face shine with joy…\nNo other actor could ever make lines in a play as popular with the audience as Mogulesko used to be able to. No one ever did it and no one ever could do it, because there was only one Mogulesko.\nMogulesko didn’t perform more than once a week. This is what his doctor ordered, and he obeyed his doctor. He only performed twice a week when there was no other choice, but never more than that. The actors in the troupe worried over him and were always ready to do anything for him to give him a little bit of joy.\nThe few performances he played that season in People’s Theater were usually those from the old repertoire. He appeared in several roles which, in years past, he had made famous and beloved by the whole Jewish world4. Once, when the decision was made to put on Goldfaden’s Di tsvey Kuni-Lemls, he requested that I play the second Kuni Leml - the fake one5.\nI was really very moved by this. It was a great honor that Mogulesko himself requested that I play the second Kuni Leml, and I prepared for the performance as though it were a great simche. And at the same time, I was scared stiff and afraid that, playing alongside him on stage, the audiences wouldn’t care about me at all, or compared to him I’d look like a fool.\nIt’s no small thing to act alongside Mogulesko in Di tsvey Kuni-Lemls!\nAt the rehearsals, I closely watched his every little gesture, trying to catch even the smallest little detail. Afterwards, I practiced them all carefully and tried with all my might to imitate the charming tricks he added to the role.\nBut I was still very worried about it. And Edelstein was always reminding me -\n– Remember, boyele! You’re playing the second Kuni Leml with Mogulesko… You have to gird yourself… Yes, yes, anyone who plays with him needs to gird themselves…\nThe evening of the performance I was so nervous, as though it were my very first time on the stage. And when the scene where I meet him - the real Kuni Leml - arrived, and I saw him in all his wretchedness and pitifulness - which itself contained a whole world of charm - my eyes suddenly burst with joy and I couldn’t remember a thing of what I was supposed to do, as I looked at him and he looked back at me in just the same way…\nAnd this was how it should be. This was a good was to play the role of the second Kuni Leml, because the real Kuni Leml should get all mixed up and then be able to say his famous line, which usually made audiences laugh:\n– If I didn’t know that I was me, I would think that you are me and I am you…\nWhat happened that evening in the theater was indescribable. Exactly like in other performances that Mogulesko appeared in in the People’s Theater after he regained his voice, the audience was packed in like sardines. It was not only his old fans who remembered him from before who came to see him, but also new fans, and among them were highly intelligent leading theater-connoisseurs who really appreciated genuine talent. And when Mogulesko came out on the stage, he said a few words and gave a short speech. I will never forget that he began by talking about me; with a loving little smile on his face, he said:\n– You must understand - every time I play Kuni Leml, I have tsures6 because the fake Kuni Leml always hams it up too much and ends up overshadowing my own playing. But Kasten doesn’t, and that is good.\nHe praised me when he was called on stage between acts to say a few words. It was such a pleasure for me, and I felt so happy and valued.\nI will never for the rest of my life forget that performance with Mogulesko, being on the same stage with him and seeing his artistic talent and creative process up close with my own eyes. Mogulesko’s whole being was a wonder on the Yiddish stage. Truly a miracle. He was a simple man, without much of an education, without any familiarity with acting theory or formal technique, and he didn’t know the history of the world stage. He didn’t know any of these things, and it didn’t concern him to know either. He had little interest even in the praise he received when people wrote about his acting. It seemed that he didn’t have any ambition. But he was so full of talent that he surpassed scores of other actors, and then some. And it was very characteristic that, when someone would ask him how he played a role so well, how he infused it with such charm.\n– Eh… - he used to answer with a smile - I just do…\nIt’s also worth recounting what Jacob P. Adler, the Nesher Hagadol himself, used to say about Mogulesko:\n– Mogulesko can make even the most foolish role sparkle and shine like a diamond…. He is such an artist that he can take a “crappy play” and give it such an ingenious jolt that when you look at the play after, you’ll see a real work of art…\nThere is only one Mogulesko on our Yiddish stage. There has never been another who can compare to him…",

    "text": "I couldn’t get much joy playing in the People’s Theater, because in those days, Bessie Thomashefsky didn’t play women’s roles - only young and nimble young men who dominated the whole stage and were usually of the mischievous and wanton sort…\nAnd so it always turned out that, when an opportunity for such a role - which was an exact fit for me - came up, it was only given to me when Boris Thomashefsky was fighting with Bessie over something and was on bad terms with her. And I really didn’t want them to fight. Just the opposite, I was good friends with both of them - indeed I was related to them2 - and in my heart I always wished that they would live in peace and grow old together in happiness and honor. But the fact that Bessie Thomashefsky acted in trousers3 really interfered with my career. Thomashefsky couldn’t give me the opportunities that he should have, and even when Edelstein tried to intervene on my behalf, it never helped.\nOnly when Adler appeared in plays from his repertoire did I get a chance to perform in a role that I actually wanted. But even though I was pleased that the Nesher Hagadol took me under his wing and put in a good word for me, it wasn’t enough.\nI then realized that, for all my longing and dreams of being in New York, playing with the “great bears”4 was not at all what I had imagined, and my heart grew heavy and I started looking for a way to get out of this unpleasant situation.\nWhat I would do, I myself didn’t know. I thought, if I only could, I would go to a different theater for the next season. But who knows if any other theater would actually hire me? After all, I was still somewhat of a newcomer in New York and not as well known as the other actors, so who would be eager to hire me? Who would pick me up? And even if someone did want me, would they pay me as much as they did in the People’s Theater?\nBut just then when I was feeling so aggrieved in the People’s Theater, having to endure the misfortune of Bessie Thomashefsky acting in trousers, something happened which I did not expect at all.\nNobody really knew where he got the title “Professor” from. Even though he himself assured everyone that, back in a university in Bucharest, he had once been a professor of geography, nobody believed really him. It was customary in theater circles that, when you called him “Professor,” you said it in a way that it sounded like a joke.\nHe was also called “the meshumed”5, and it was said that indeed years ago, when he was considered a great expert and learned shchite6 to become a shoychet7, he suddenly joined the Haskalah8, learned German, and wrote in a German newspaper. And just as he wrote in German, he also wrote in Romanian and Hebrew. He was sure that, in his newfound refinement, he would of course climb high on the social ladder.\nHe came from Galicia. He was born in Stanislav, and he loved to boast that his family traced its lineage to Shelah HaKoydesh. And it was known that when he was a young 20-something, or maybe 30, one fine morning he suddenly converted and become a missionary, all to be able to pay off some debts9. But after a little time had passed and he had put away a little money, he returned to Judaism. He caused such a spectacle when this happened, and he began to call himself “Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy”.\nPeople also used to say that when he became a Jew again in Bucharest, he convened a group of coachmen, and he went with them to a pub and got them a couple liters of wine and “made their hearts merry with wine”10 and gave a sermon, quoting verses from the Toire and the Gemore11, and he wove in some story about Terach12 and Avrohom Avinu13, about how someone who used to worship idols became a Jew who now worships Rebbeinu Shel Oylem, and so therefore they should welcome him with opens arms back into the people of Israel.\nAfterwards, in Romania, the “Professor” suddenly took an interest in Yiddish theater. This was around the same time that Abraham Goldfaden laid the foundations of the Yiddish stage. He competed with Goldfaden, churning out new plays as quickly as you baked matzos. Overnight, he could whip up a whole new play. He would quickly grab up new plays - a goyishe play from somewhere or another - as soon as he saw it, and before you even expected it, he would “Yiddish-ify” it so that even the original author didn’t recognize it…\nAnd if he didn’t have a goyishe play on hand when he needed it, he would just take a chapter of Jewish history and quickly turn it into a play - and it worked just as well. He was really an interesting character, the “Professor.”\nWhen he came to America and became a Yiddish theater director, he behaved like a magnate. He spent money like water and lived very comfortably, as a magnate does. He always dressed so that all eyes were on him when he went down the street, always wearing the finest cloak with the most beautiful top hat. His clothes were fresh off the needle and made of the best fabric, and to make an impression, he rode around in his own carriage with two fine, plump horses, and his coachman who drove the carriage was always dressed in a uniform with golden buttons.\nGenerally speaking, in those days this business with carriages was very in vogue in the Yiddish theater world. Adler drove around in a carriage with two fine horses. Boris Thomashefsky too drove around in a carriage with two plump horses. The only one of the big theater managers who didn’t have his own carriage and coachman with golden buttons was Yosl Edelstein. And if you asked why he too didn’t buy himself a carriage, he answered, in his own peculiar way:\n– Eh, who needs it! May they all crash, those fools… No good, I tell you, will come from traveling in a carriage… None at all! You can die from one of those things… May they all crash… I’m fine just being a manager….14\nEdelstein never envied anyone who lived lavishly. His thought it was nothing more than an attempt to blow smoke in people’s faces. And the worst of them all was the “Professor.”\nThat was the kind of person he was, Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy, who was known in those times as the “king” of shund on the Yiddish stage in America. And just as he was never offended by those who called him “Professor” in a sarcastic tone, he also wasn’t offended when people called him “meshumed.”\nMany times, I heard Jacob Gordin say to him:\n– Hey, you…meshumed!…\nAnd the “Professor” took it as quite a normal thing, nothing to make a whole fuss over, and he’d usually say back to Gordin -\n– Nu, what do you want to ask me, goy?\nThat’s what he called Gordin - goy! It irritated him that he was learned but Gordin wasn’t.\n– People should know their Toire - he would say - Oi, people should know it!… It comes in handy.\nOthers too in the Yiddish theater world called the “Professor” meshumed. He was used to it, so it didn’t bother him.\nIt never occurred to me to go to the Windsor Theater and ask to anyone, let alone the “Professor” himself, if they wanted to hire me for the next season. But it turned out that I didn’t have to go to him - someone from the Windsor Theater had already come to me. And it happened by chance, as I later found out.\nThe “Professor”’s daughter had seen me perform once in the People’s Theater, and she loved my acting so much that she immediately when to her father and told him that they needed an actor exactly like me in the Windsor Theater.\nHe always relied on his daughter’s expertise; she used to go around to all the other theaters and look for new talent for the Windsor Theater. He asked her what kind of roles I played and how I sang and danced, and after taking it all in, he bit his lower lip, like he always used to do when he wanted to say something. And he said:\n– If this is true, they’re taking him for granted…\nAnd he sent a messenger to me, who told me that on Shabbes day I should come to the Windsor Theater to see the “Professor” - that he needed to see me and wanted to talk with me…",

    "text": "The messenger who came to tell me that Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy, the “Professor” himself as he was called, wanted to see me was Anshel Schorr. And as usual, he behaved as though this whole matter was a secret that must be kept from the whole world.\nHe was still a griner2, Anshel Schorr, very energetic and very skilled. But he quickly caught on and adapted to the American ways, so they called him “the yellow griner.” Heine-Chaimovich gave him the name, and it stuck.\nAnshel Schorr was the “Professor”’s right hand man at the Windsor Theater, and he attended to everything the “Professor” needed. When a song needed to be written, he wrote a song, and when a scene needed to be staged, he staged a scene. And on top of this, he understood the audience well and knew what they wanted. All in all, Anshel Schorr already had the makings of a “Theatrical Bismarck,” as he was later called, and everything he did made it seem like he really had a firm grasp on all the politics one needed to know.\nIt goes without saying that I didn’t play hard to get, and I went to the Windsor Theater to see the “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy at the requested time. And when he saw me, he immediately got to the point:\n– Hear me out - he said like it was an order - I’ve heard, as they tell me, that in People’s Theater they pay you $30 a week. Nu, I will pay you $40 a week if you sign with me to play with us in the Windsor Theater next season.\nI signed right there on the spot, and it was settled that I would play with the Windsor Theater for the whole next year.\nI didn’t need to make a secret out of it. I told the managers of the People’s Theater right away that next season I had decided to join the “Professor”’s troupe in the Windsor Theater. They were happy for me, or at least that’s how it seemed to me. But Edelstein was upset that I didn’t tell him earlier I was thinking of leaving. And let me say, this was not unreasonable; I should have told him about it earlier, because he had always really stood up for me and treated me very well. But the deal had been made, and there was no going back. I was really looking forward to it too. I had to get out of the situation I was stuck in in the People’s Theater where I never got the opportunities I wanted because Bessie Thomashefsky was always “playing in trousers” and getting all the roles that, in my opinion, I was better suited for…\nThe truth was, in those days the “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy’s career was heading downhill, and his plays which he quickly threw together like he was baking fresh buns were not as well-received as they used to be. New winds had started to blow in the Yiddish theater. Audiences were developing more sophisticated tastes, and the leading actors had a strong interest in playing better roles. The historical and non-historical operettas that the “Professor” churned out looked more and more ridiculous. But the “Professor”, he was still very impressed with himself and still acted like a wealthy prince, a great magnate, throwing money around left and right.\nIndeed, while signing the deal with me, he felt generous and gave me several hundred dollars on the spot for me to live on over the summer, because I wasn’t able to put much away from the $30 a week I was getting from the People’s Theater.\nAnd when I showed up to rehearsals at the Windsor Theater at the end of the summer, we were told that the new play the “Professor” had written was something like no one in America had ever seen before. There was no doubt that it would be a great success - so successful that the other theater managers would eat themselves alive with jealousy…\nThe new play was a historical operetta called Yesties Mitsraïm, and actors cast in the play included Leon Blank, Kalmen Juvelier, Shrage, and many other famous actors. Dora Weissman3, the daughter of the well-known Reuben Weissman who was considered the most intelligent man in the theater world, was cast in the female roles.\nShe was young and beautiful then, the talented actress Dora Weissman. On top of that, in the Yiddish theater she was someone who was known as a “product of America.” When she came to America with her parents from Odessa, she was no more than two or maybe three years old, she was educated in America schools, and she knew the American stage well because she never failed to miss seeing an English play. More than anything, she loved musical comedies with singing and dancing. She was good-natured, and she danced beautifully, like a real classically-trained actress who acts in musical theater. In the operetta Yesties Mitsraïm, which was supposed to be something of a musical comedy, she was given the role of an Egyptian princess in Pharaoh’s court. The role was written so that she would have dancing and singing parts.\nThey also made sure that I too would be able to sing and dance in this historical operetta. I was given the role of an Egyptian prince who was also in Pharaoh’s court, the same Pharaoh who forced the Jews into slavery to build Pithom and Rameses4. This role was written so that the audiences wouldn’t think ill of the prince, indeed the opposite, because in the end of the play, he would suddenly become a true friend of the Jewish people and go with the Jews out of Egypt, along with the princess played by Dora Weissman. Both of us, as a pair, would sing and dance together. At rehearsals, the “Professor” himself said to us that we had to do this together, so that all of New York would lose their minds.\n– It has to really be something, something there has never been before until now! - as the “Professor” would say to us in his daytshmerish5…\nJust like Dora Weissman, I was also a huge lover of English musical comedies. I never missed a musical comedy performance on the American stage, and I had always enjoyed how men and women danced together, as a couple, both following the same rhythm and harmony. Together, Dora Weissman and I studied a dance like this, a dance just like they did in a good musical comedy on the American stage. This was something really new for the Yiddish theater, a big todo, because in general, this sort of thing was not done on the Yiddish stage. This sort of thing was not even considered. It was looked upon as though it was in real life - when men and women danced, the man should dance to one rhythm while the woman should dance to another.\nEven the great artist Mogulesko didn’t do such things. Even as he spoke and sang and danced with a world of rhythm, he would go along with one rhythm, and others would go along with another rhythm… With his great talent, Mogulesko could do anything, but others couldn’t, and therefore it always looked ridiculous to see two people dancing to completely unrelated rhythms on stage at the same time.\nWhile rehearsing our dance, Dora Weissman and I were very pleased that we had the genius idea to bring such a good thing from the American to the Yiddish stage. When everyone saw how we were dancing together as a pair, we were sure it would be a big success because it was something new which had rarely, if ever, been seen before on the Yiddish stage.\nWe impatiently looked forward to our first performance. During rehearsals for Yesties Mitsraïm - a play that was supposed to “conquer the world” - we had a lot of tsures because we could tell that even though the “Professor” said he had already written the whole piece, were always missing a few pages here and there that he was still wrapping up. I remember once how during rehearsals, we suddenly came to a scene that just ended in the middle. If this scene wasn’t finished, we wouldn’t be able to proceed because the audiences definitely would not understand what was happening. The “Professor” furrowed his brow, and he said something that nobody understood at first because we had no idea what he meant by it:\n– Aha! - he exclaimed - The stick!\nWhat stick, who stick?…he didn’t say. Only later did we catch on to what he meant - he meant that he needed, right there on the spot, to write a song about the staff that Moishe Rabbeinu used to perform miracles when he confronted the Pharaoh and later used to part the Red Sea… The song about the staff would take the place of the scene that he should have written, but of course did not write, and I would sing the song… Me - in the role of an Egyptian prince who began as an enemy of the Jewish people but later became their friend and left Egypt with them guided by Moishe Rabbeinu to the land of Canaan, the land where milk and honey flows and goats graze on carobs as much as grass…\nAnd indeed right there on the spot, the “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy called over the theater’s two musical directors - Herman Wohl and Arnold Perlmutter6, as well as Anshel Schorr - and he gave them an order:\n– You, Anshel, write this song right away, the song about the stick. You write the words, and you two - he pointed to Wohl and Perlmutter - go write the music…\nAnd so they did…7.\nAnshel Schorr wrote and erased, erased and wrote, added a rhyme, removed a rhyme. Wohl and Perlmutter also, in their own way, wrote and erased, erased and wrote, trying out different notes on the piano. The sweat was pouring out of all three of them, all working hurriedly to write a song they hadn’t ever thought about before. And when the finished writing the song about Moishe Rabbeinu’s staff, the “Professor,” with a pleased smile on his face, said:\n– This will work and it will go well…\nThe whole way of rehearsing in the Windsor Theater, where we had to wait for the “Professor” to hand out pages here and there from operetta Yesties Mitsraïm was something entirely unusual. Everyone was really exasperated but at the same time cracked jokes and laughed about it. But I haven’t even told you the best part yet - I’ll tell you about it in the next chapter…",

    "text": "I tried to muster the strength to tell jokes, but my heart was heavy and dark.\nThe only one who was calm and didn’t take the whole situation to heart was the “Professor” himself. For all the grief we gave him, he had one response:\n– You don’t have to worry. There will be a last act…\nWe, of course, thought he would have written the last act and given us direction on how to perform it by now, even though we wouldn’t have time to learn or rehearse it. We grew more and more nervous, and between acts, actors kept grabbing at pages from the “Professor” -\n– Give us our roles! Let us learn our lines for the last act!\nIt went like this the whole time, until the curtain had to go up for the last act. When the chaos among the actors reached its peak, since none of us knew what was going to happen or how the play was going to end, the “Professor,” all calm and collected, said:\n– Now, everyone go up onto the stage and line up in order!\nWe were shocked when we heard this. What would we do up there on the stage without a last act? What will we say when none of us has been given any lines…?\nBut when the “Professor” says to go up onto the stage, onto the stage you go. We all went up on stage and lined up in order. Standing there, we all exchanged glances - “What’s it going to be? What’s going to happen?”\nAnd this is what happened…Yes, it happened just like this, something none of us expected:\nAs soon as the curtain went up, the “Professor” himself came onto the stage wearing a long white coat and a white beard he had attached to himself. He stood tall like a prophet or some kind of God-like figure, and raising one hand in the air he began to speak to Moishe Rabbeinu:\n– Moishe, Moishe, take the Jews and lead them to the land where milk and honey flow, to the land of the cedars!\nAnd he went on and on like this in his daytshmerish, and while speaking, he interspersed verses from the Toire, and then switched back to daytshmerish. He performed the whole last act by himself like a sort of epilogue to Yesties Mitsraïm itself. It was an endlessly long1 monologue, but he played it in a way that immediately won over the audience. He also brought us actors into it; he kept asking questions that we had to answer with a resounding “Yes!” And he ended with a bang that the audience loved. The curtains lowered, and the play was finally over.\nThis is how the “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy ended his operetta Yesties Mitsraïm, since he didn’t feel like or didn’t have time to actually write the last act. And we continued to perform the play exactly like this; even though it wasn’t entirely clear who the man in white was meant to portray, he gave Moishe Rabbeinu the order to lead the Jews to the land that flows with milk and honey, where the cedars grow… Was it a spirit? Or was it God himself? No real indication was given, and the “Professor” didn’t even really know. And when you asked the “Professor” about it, he usually gave the answer - “Don’t ask such questions…”\nThe same role - the role of the man in white - was later played by Leon Blank. And when he asked the “Professor” to give him the lines of the monologue, the “Professor” laughed:\n– There aren’t any. - he said. - The monologue wasn’t written out. I just said whatever came to mind…\nAnd this was the God’s honest truth. He just said whatever occurred to him on the spot. This was nothing new for him; he would often just go onto the stage to play a role in his own play, and when he did he didn’t say lines from a script - he just said whatever came to mind. This is what he did in play Tisa Esler2, where he played the role of the lawyer who defends the Jew accused of blood libel. He spoke entirely different lines at each performance, just as he did in his operetta Yesties Mitsraïm, for which he didn’t ever write the last act…\nAnd when Blank asked if he could write out the same monologue that went over so well, he laughed again:\n– Do you really think I remember what I said in the monologue?! I don’t remember a single word that I said…\nHe wrote a monologue for Blank anyways, but it was a whole other monologue entirely. Not at all the same words…\nThe operetta Yesties Mitsraïm was not a great success because, as I said earlier, in those times new winds were beginning to blow in the Yiddish theater. The sort of plays the “Professor” wrote were quickly going out of style, and nobody knew this better than he did. That’s why he tried so hard to make such a huge spectacle with this operetta, like using actual frogs when portraying the ten plagues, along with other special effects. But it didn’t help. The play was not a big hit.\nBut I was happy that we put on the play, as was Dora Weissman, because we danced together as a couple, which was not normally done in the Yiddish theater. We were both really pleased. The theater critics also gave us good reviews in the papers. If my memory serves me well, Abe Cahan, the editor of the Forverts, wrote that the “Professor”’s historical operetta was like a fur that you have no desire to wear because it’s certainly not fur you can pride yourself on. So, you put it away on a hanger worth more than the fur itself, the kind of hanger on which you’d hang a respectable fur that you can pride yourself on. This is also the case with the dance that Sam Kasten and Dora Weissman danced as a couple: It was the good sort of hanger you can hang a fur on - a fur that was certainly not one of the nicest.\nThis is more or less, if I remember correctly, what Abe Cahan wrote about the piece. He was delighted with my performance, you see, and I was really moved by it. The memory of this second season in New York, where I didn’t go downhill but instead I took my place on the Yiddish stage, really brings me a lot of joy.",

    "text": "The whole time I played in the Windsor Theater, I knew that whenever we put on a new play by Horowitz, the last act would not be finished by the first performance. It became like a mineg1 which you can’t change. The “Professor” never seemed to be in a rush to write the last act, and usually he assumed that, when it came time to put on the show, we’d figure it out.\nWe, the actors in the troupe, joked around a lot. All in all, the atmosphere was one where no one really immersed themselves in their role, and everything was done haphazardly like it was all a farce.\nIn those days, Jacob P. Adler parted ways with Thomashefsky and Edelstein and began to perform in the Grand Theater on Grand Street4, and David Kessler played with him. They engaged Madame Bertha Kalich to play the lead female roles. This was really a winning combination to put on serious dramas of a better sort, although the two great actors Adler and Kessler very often could not get along and they could not share the glory. Kessler loved to say that Adler was not the kind of actor who could play with natural realism, but rather he always had to do all kinds of tricks and put on airs like he wanted to go around a cloud…\nEvery time when the two of them performed together in a play, they would both try to “out-act” the other. One time Kessler was feeling mischievous and pulled some trick in the middle of the play that made Adler fall out of character, and it was very hard for him get back into his role.\nFor the new season5, Dora Weissman and I were hired to play at the Grand Theater, and I was really happy to have the opportunity to perform in better plays alongside great actors like David Kessler and Jacob P. Adler. I performed in plays there like Leon Kobrin’s East Side Ghetto6 and Z. Libin’s Helene, oder Di Yidishe Medea7.\nIn Libin’s play, Madame Bertha Kalich played the lead role, and the audiences really loved her performance. She worked really hard to create an interesting character of a Jewish woman and took the preparation very seriously. Generally speaking, people in the Yiddish theater circles took Libin’s plays very seriously. He was still a young dramatist, and people had very high hopes for him.\nIn the piece Helene, oder Di Yidishe Medea, I played a griner Jew who carried newspapers to his regular customers and was always tired because he never got enough sleep. There was one scene where I was woken from my sleep, and I awoke with a start in such a tumult that I had no idea where I was at all. The audiences laughed a lot at how I played this scene, as I leapt up and got dressed in such a hurry that I fell all over myself, putting my left shoe on my right foot and the right shoe on my left foot.\nWhen I played this scene, it all came very naturally to me.8 This character in Libin’s play was very dear to my heart because, all in all, he was a very sympathetic mentshl9, a nebech10 who toiled away and worked very hard to earn himself a piece of bread in America. And I remembered how every time I played the scene where I was startled awake, Madame Bertha Kalich looked at me like I was a poor, sympathetic mentshl and it touched her heart. You could tell that she was really pleased with how my performance showed how very flustered and lost he was.\nOnce, after a performance of Libin’s play, Madame Kalich ran up to my dressing room and told me that the next evening, I should come to her house.\n– Dora Weissman will also be there, - she said. - My husband, Leopold Shpachner11, will see you both. He has to discuss something very important with you…\nMadame Kalich didn’t tell us what Shpachner wanted to speak with us about, but we understood that it would certainly be something new. And indeed it was.\nWhen we went to Madame Kalich’s house, Shpachner told us that next season he would be managing a new theater. He was putting together a troupe, and he wanted Dora Weissman and I to go with him.\nWithout missing a beat he immediately offered me $60 a week, which in those days was quite a lot of money. He also offered this to Dora Weissman. And as it usually went in these situations, he promised that he would see to it that we would have good roles with lots of lines and songs to sing and dance in the plays that he staged.\nBut where would we play?\nIn the Windsor Theater.\nShpachner had already seen to it that we would take over the Windsor Theater, because the “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy was no longer there. He had left the stage and had no further role to play…\nIt happened so suddenly and surprised everyone; the “Professor,” apparently, realized that, with the new winds blowing in the Yiddish theater, he was rolling more and more downhill, along with his historical and non-historical operettas and melodramas. He wasn’t able to adapt to the new ways, so he chose to take up something else. He brought over an Italian opera company from Europe, and he figured that maybe with them, he’d be able to compete with the Yiddish theater and would again be able to earn a lot of money. He figured he would became an “opera impresario” and wouldn’t have anything more to do with the Yiddish theater. As usual, his imagination ran wild. He was already building his castles in the sky, living large and traveling around in an even better carriage, with even plumper horses and a lackey too in a uniform with golden buttons.\nBut in a short time, he had spent all his money on the Italian opera company, including all the money he borrowed too. And the end was really very sad.\nThe “Professor” became paralyzed and was admitted to the Montefoire House. Impoverished, destitute, and broken, he languished there for several years. And when he died in 191012, only a few actors and others from the theater circles attended his funeral, which was held in a stable on Houston Street.\nAnd so ended the life of “Professor” Moishe Ish Horowitz Halevy, whose plays - which he wrote in such a hurry that he never had time to write the last act - reigned for years on the Yiddish stage. It was the end of a man in the Yiddish theater who lived so largely that people really thought of his as a wealthy magnate. He was 66 years old13.",

    "text": "This is how he usually spoke about a play that he didn’t like, and this time he was even more biting…\nBut Feinman was not deterred by the fact that David Kessler did not care for his writing, and he kept writing plays. And when someone put on one of his plays, he was in seventh heaven. He didn’t care about what “royalties” he would get, just that he wasn’t only an actor - but also a playwright…\nFeinman did well with his play Der Yud in Sobietski’s Zayten. This play was a great success in the Kalich Theater, and it was played for two more seasons. It goes without saying that the lead role of the great Rabbi who stands up for the Jews was played by Feinman himself, since he loved the role very much, and he was sure that no other actor would play it as well as him.\nIn the play, Dora Weissman and I again played as a couple, and it was just as Shpachner promised - we had enough to sing and say and dance in our roles. Dora’s character was named Paye, and mine was named Shmaye, and the audience greatly enjoyed the scene we played together. Everyone was lively and joyous, and the crowd went wild for Paye and Shmaye.\nThe lively little couple that Dora Weissman and I created in the play Der Yud in Sobietski’s Zayten brought a lot of joy to thousands and thousands of Jews, and everywhere you went, you’d hear people talking about Paye and Shmaye. It was enough to just mention those two names for people to start laughing.\nIn the middle of the week in the Kalich Theater, we put on other plays. One of them, I remember, was called Di Yerushe, but I no longer remember the name of the playwright6 I only remember that I played the role of some kind of snub-nosed cavalier who was courting a beautiful young woman. She tells him that she will only marry him if he goes to Paris and gets himself a better nose. He does what she asks and goes to Paris to get a smaller nose, but when he returns, he is left only with his new nose - because it turns out the beautiful young woman had cheated on him.Just went he left for Paris, she up and married someone else…\nIt goes without saying that the role of the beautiful maiden, who the snub-nosed cavalier courted and was so in love with, was played by Dora Weissman, and she brought a lot of life and humor into the role. Mogulesko wrote a little ditty for the cavalier to sing, and even now I remember the nign7:\nIn general, Mogulesko helped me out anytime I needed some kind of little song in a comical role. Whenever I asked him for one, he not only wrote it, but he practiced it with me to show me how to sing it. Not just for me, but also for other actors, Mogulesko on many occasions showed a fine, authentic collegiality. He was always ready to help you prepare for a role, to show you what to do and how to embody the character you were playing.\nOnce, when I appeared in “Professor” Horowitz’s play Dos Poylishe Yingl, I played the role of the shadchan Shmuel Gorgel, a role in which Mogulesko so excelled that he simply had no equal. I asked him if he would help me prepare for this role and show me how he played it so I could imitate his acting. It was hard for me to come to him with this request, because in those days he was ill again and he rarely performed. I remembered that I thought he would of course be upset to hear I was given the role, and he would consider it insolent and tactless that I would ask him to show me how to play a role he was so excellent in.\nBut he took it exactly the opposite way and gladly showed me how to play the role, and on the evening of the performance he came to the theater to see me and encouraged me8. Now I will recount something that reflects who Mogulesko was as an artist:\nAfter the performance, Mogulesko told me that overall I did a good job in the role, but in the third act I made him look like a fool…\nAt first I didn’t understand. Only when he explained to me did I realize that he was right. I began to see why no one applauded me when I left the stage at the end of the scene, even though audiences usually applauded this scene.\nThe scene takes place in the wealthy Rabbi’s home, and the shadchan sees that the table drawer is open with money sitting in it. As a poor Jew, he needs money. The urge comes over him to take a little, even though he knows that stealing is a sin. He starts calling for the man of the house, “Rabbi Kalman! Come here, Rabbi Kalman!” But Rabbi Kalman is very busy, so he doesn’t come. The poor shadchan cannot resist the temptation, and he grabs some coins from the open drawer and leaves.\nWhile playing this scene, Mogulesko was fastidious about every little detail, acting even with his eyes to hold the whole audience in suspense. When he saw the open drawer, his looked at it so acutely that the whole audience was fixated on his gaze, and had no choice but to look at the drawer along with him. And when he called out for Rabbi Kalman, you could hear in his voice that he wanted the Rabbi to rescue him from sin. He didn’t call out for Rabbi Kalman one time, but instead three or four times. And after each time, when the he still didn’t come, Mogulesko reached out with a trembling hand and grabbed a few coins and stashed them in his pocket, and then again called out for Rabbi Kalman. When he finished stashing all the coins away in his pocket, he left.\nThis is how Mogulesko used to perform this scene, which audiences really loved to see because he performed it with such a unique artistic charm. Every little movement, every dart of his eye, was precisely planned and expressed with feeling. But when I played the scene, I didn’t think about it as much, and I didn’t fully grasp it when he showed me how to play it. And so in the scene I simply grabbed all the money at once and left. That’s why the scene went poorly and the audience didn’t applaud. I didn’t deserve any applause…\nFrom then on, I knew that when Mogulesko showed me how to perform a role, or when I saw him on stage, I should not take my eyes off him for even one second. I had to watch every little thing he did. Missing something was like losing a link from a gold chain…\nAnd he, the great artist, the master of character development on the Yiddish stage, was so modest that whenever he had to play a role that a different actor besides him had played before, he would go to them and ask that them to show him how to play the role. He once even came to me with such a request and asked me to show him how to play a well-known role of a butcher in some play whose name I don’t remember. Berl Bernstein used to play this role, and he played the butcher in his usual way, dancing a hopke and doing a yom pom pom, waving his hands around and raising them in the air. I confess, when I was given the role, I imitated Bernstein more than a little, and I told this to Mogulesko when I showed him how to play the role. And Mogulesko told me in response,\n– That’s not bad, that’s okay. Show me everything. Let me see.\nAnd he watched me do it all, asking me questions about it over and over again, just as he would teach other actors how to play his roles. And when later I went to see him perform the role of the butcher, I watched with my eyes wide open because I wanted to take it all in, how Mogulesko transformed the butcher into something I had never seen before. This was truly a whole different butcher - not mine, not Bernstein’s, but a real life butcher just as you would see in a butcher shop. Even though he performed the role as I had shown him, he also made it something else entirely. And it could not have gone any other way, because nobody was as great a performer as he was. There has never been anyone else like Mogulesko on our Yiddish stage.\nWhen you think about it, it’s been more than thirty years since he passed away9, and still no one has turned his memoirs, which were published in Forverts, into a book. Mogulesko himself, I know, used to come to the newsroom of the Forverts, and he told his life story which Abe Cahan wrote. But Abe Cahan didn’t finish it because he got too busy, so he handed the writing over to Leon Gottlieb, and I know that Gottlieb took it over with love, because just like Abe Cahan, he was also greatly impressed by Mogulesko’s talent.\nMogulesko’s memoirs really should be published as a book, and everyone should read it. Not only Yiddish actors, but anyone who is interested in the Yiddish theater and the origins of the great Yiddish artist. Perhaps some folks at the Hebrew Actors' Union have thought about doing this? It would be a beautiful monument to the great artist Mogulesko, who had a profound impact and left a deep mark on the Yiddish theater not only in America, but across the whole world.",

    "text": "1905/1906↩︎\nformerly known as the Windsor Theater↩︎\nSobietsky was John III Sobieski, the King of Poland from 1629-1696. Sam is not correct about the debut: This play did not open the season, but rather premiered in December 1905, as shown in the advertisement to the right. It is possible to further speculate on why he was mistaken about the premiere date. The first reason, of course, is that this occurred over 40 years ago in Sam’s life relative to when he wrote his memoirs. The second reason is that Sam was likely ill at the time suffering from severe stomach cramping (cause unknown to us), and his debilitating pain may have influenced his recollection of this time of his life. We know he was suffering because of this article/advertisement from March 9th, 1907 where he describes his chronic illness - and how the doctors in the Vienna Medical Office on 106 E 11th St cured him when no one else was able to. Indeed, it seems Sam became somewhat of a celebrity spokesperson for the Viennese doctors, with the same article/advertisement reprinted in future newspapers (both in Di Vahrhayt and other newspapers) to further promote the medical institute.↩︎\na nickname↩︎\nTranslation of advertisement for Der Yud in Sobietski’s Zayten:\n\nKalich Theater\nFriday Dec. 29th evening, Shabbes Dec. 30th matinee and evening, Sunday Dec. 31st matinee and evening, and Jan. 1st (New Years) 1906, for the first time the long-awaited historical opera in four acts Rabbi Leyb Sephardi or Der Yud in Sobietski’s Zayten. Historical opera about the Jews in Poland, written by Professor Yakoby of London, staged by Herr Z. Feinman, music by Perlmutter and Wohl, extraordinary scenery painted by T.S. (Ch?) Godfellow, ballet, dances, and marches by Professor Baraban, electric effects by the electrician Pete. Lyrics for all songs and couplets by the poet Smulewitz. Herr Feinman as Rabbi Leyb Sephardi, Herr Juvelier as Yosef Roland. In Act 3 Juvelier will sing the well-known song “Der Lis” (דער לית).\n\n↩︎\nThe playwright’s name was George (Gershon) Zeikin; His biography available from Volume 1 page 774 of the Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater.↩︎\nA different song that Sam sang in this role was called “It’s just my nose that’s to blame.” You can find the sheet music here as well as a translation and modern-day rendition of it here.↩︎\nThis event is also mentioned in Mogulesko’s Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater entry, as copied here from the translation available on the Museum of Family History website:\n\nLeon Blank similarly recalls: “(Sam Kasten) had to play the role of ‘Shmuel Gorgel the Matchmaker’ in ‘Professor’ Horowitz’s ’Dos poylishe yingel (The Polish Youth)” – a role, in which Mogulesko had strongly excelled in. … Without a scrap of jealousy, with the best feeling, and with the earliest wish, Mogulesko showed Kasten how he handled the role, how he played it, and in the evening of the performance he came to the theatre. On various occasions, one could see Mogulesko’s close relationship with his other colleagues. He never provided anyone with a shot. Turned out, he was always ready to help that out -demonstrating, learning, acting in a [certain] way. When he was in a play with another comedian, he saw that the latter should have no smaller role, and no less with a song, And, in fact, the songwriter himself wrote to another comedian and himself adapted the music.”\n\n↩︎\nMogulesko died in 1914, as Sam will tell us about later.↩︎",

    "text": "At the end of the second season in the Kalich Theater, we were told that next year there would be no more performances there because the building was being torn down to make way for the great bridge that would connect New York with Brooklyn - now the well-known “Manhattan Bridge.”\nI was naturally very sorry that the Windsor Theater1 was being demolished - after all, I had made a name for myself there during the first few years I played in New York. And even to this day, when I walk past the Manhattan Bridge, I usually stop there for a moment. Somehow instinctively I pause, and I think to myself - once upon a time, the Windsor Theater stood here.\nAfter the season2 ended, Anshel Schorr came to me with an offer to play in Philadelphia in Mike Thomashefsky’s Columbia Theater, and we agreed I would be paid $100/week. On top of that, they’d hire my wife as well and pay her $25/week. Mike Thomashefsky put together a troupe in Philadelphia of big-name actors, among whom was Schwartz, the same Maurice Schwartz who later created the Yiddish Art Theater. But at that time, no one imagined that one day he would create such great things for the Yiddish stage and that he would launch a new chapter in the history of Yiddish theater in America.\nGenerally speaking, the Yiddish theater in Philadelphia was nowhere near the level of New York and simply could not compete with it. In Philadelphia, they would put on the same plays that were popular in New York, and they played them like there really wasn’t anything to be ashamed of. It was common that a popular play would have a longer run in Philadelphia than in New York, and I remember how once, in Mike Thomashefsky’s Columbia Theater3, we put on A Mensch Zol Men Zeyn4, which Moishe Schorr5 and Anshel Schorr wrote together, for a record 25 weeks in a row. And we played it so well that the theater bigwigs even came down from New York to see us play it.\nI played in Philadelphia for three seasons6. I achieved such renown that even people who remembered me well from the early days and called me “Samke” back when I was struggling to make a name for myself, started to call me “Mr. Kasten,” and I had many great fans among them.\nBut I still yearned to be back in New York, and when I was offered a job at the Thalia Theater7, I grabbed at it. At that time, there were three managers of the Thalia Theater - David Kessler, Boaz Young, and Max Wilner. Max Wilner, who was David Kessler’s second wife’s son, managed the business. He was jack of many trades and handled all aspects of the theater business, but he didn’t talk much. With a cigar in the corner of his mouth, he would sit around for hours and say only a few words, but that didn’t mean that he had nothing to say. On the contrary, he always had an opinion about everything, and also a well-thought out plan, and usually he’d see it through and make sure it all went as he wanted.\nI always loved to work with David Kessler. But at the same time, I was also afraid of him because when he became capricious on the stage, or suddenly went in a rage over something, he was impossible to put up with. And when he would, in the middle of performing, start to growl his famous “No” from between his teeth with his own strange sort of sharp grunt, it freaked everyone out and completely disoriented them. I remember how one time I said to him:\n– Listen, Mr. Kessler, if you start to growl “No” at me one more time on the stage, I’ll cause a scene!\n– A scene? - He said, glaring back at me with his two great eyes. - Pray tell, what exactly, Kasey8, will you do?\n– I’ll yell “fire!” on the stage! - I answered.\nBut really, I did love working with Kessler because he was a great artist who knew what he wanted, even if he couldn’t express it in words. And that’s why I jumped at the offer to join the Thalia Theater troupe where he, the great David Kessler, was one of the managers. Maurice Schwartz was also hired with me. Together, my wife9 and I were paid a total of $220/week. I don’t know how much they paid Schwartz…\nWhile working out my contract, an amusing scene took place, and I have to tell you about it. I was in a restaurant on 2nd Avenue with Max Wilner on one side, and with Charlie Weinblatt - the son of the old Yiddish actor Yisroel Weinblatt who became a farmer10 and wanted his son Charlie to also be a farmer. Charlie didn’t want to be a farmer, but a lawyer, and he was usually involved in contract negotiation between actors and theater managers. He had a good sense of humor, and everyone always had good jokes to tell about their time with him, but no one told better jokes than Charlie Weinblatt himself.\nSo, the three of us were sitting around haggling. Not only about the price, how much my wife and I would get paid a week, but also about how they would advertise me and how big my picture would be on the placards. All the kinds of things which are very important to actors… And every time Wilner tossed the cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other and said a few carefully considered words, I nudged Charlie with my foot under the table, to tell him to speak up for me and fight for a better deal.\nIt went on like this the whole time, but I didn’t know that, just as I was kicking Charlie, so was Wilner - he was also kicking Charlie under the table…\nAnd suddenly Charlie Weinblatt, with a wide smile on his face, said to both me and Wilner:\n– Now listen here, when you both stop kicking me under the table, I’ll know that everyone got what they wanted in the deal and both parties are satisfied… Take your feet off of me because when you kick me I can’t think straight…!\nWe all laughed at this, and afterwards Charlie Weinblatt himself told everyone in the theater circles about it, and they were all in stitches laughing about it.\nThe plan that Wilner made for kicking off the new season in the Thialia Theater was totally shot, because Adler beat us to the punch - he bought the Thalia Theater and became the new manager. Because of this, Kessler was suddenly left without a theater in New York - apparently just as Adler wanted. But Wilner found a solution about what to do with the whole troupe he had hired. He split the troupe in two and rented out the Lyric Theater in Brooklyn and the Liberty Theater in Brownsville, and we started the season with Joseph Lateiner’s piece Yom Hachupe11.\nIt was perhaps Kessler’s great misfortune that his heyday on the Yiddish stage was in those days just when long monologues were the main thing. He wasn’t so good at those, because he was much more of a physical actor. His acting was more powerful without words than with, and on top of that he was far too impatient to memorize the sea of words in long monologues.\nIn the rehearsals he held with actors when preparing for a new piece, or even an old one, he used to tell such stories that it was no wonder that everyone would talk about them after. I remember one time in the Lyric Theater when we were rehearsing one of Gorky’s plays, he suddenly, is his own special way, launched into a whole discourse:\n– What is a play? - He posed a question and soon answered it himself. - A play is…is - words! And what are the words that one performs in a play? The words are seeds which the actors gather up from the ground… Just like birds and doves peck at seeds… The seeds roll around on the ground, and you have to peck at them with your beaks and get a taste for them…Understand?\nAnd with that, he finished the speech about the seeds. And when Kessler was not pleased with how an actor was playing a role in rehearsals, he’d usually grumble his famous “No,” which made everyone very nervous, and then he’d say:\n– What do I want from you, eh? I want you to peck at the seeds…Like this: With your beak, just like a bird, pick up a seed and give it to me… You see!?… Just like that!…\nAnd he would show the actor how to peck at the seed…\nAlso, when he himself would be in the middle of a performance on the stage, he would sometimes stand there saying nothing, because he really didn’t know the role, and between his teeth he would growl at the prompter:\n– Gazlen13! Mumzer14! Give me a seed…\nIt was often difficult to perform with him. Difficult and yet pleasant, because he was such a great artist that he could get away with his caprices…",

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the rehearsals with David Kessler in Brooklyn’s Lyric Theater while we were putting on Gorky’s play, Kessler was harder on Schwartz1 than on than anyone else. Kessler would always single him out, and whatever Schwartz did, Kessler was not pleased with it and scowled at him,\n– Not like that!…\nThis was David Kessler’s nature: During rehearsals, he would torment the good actors more than the others. And if you asked him why he never did this with the established actors who, in reality, barely had a crumb of talent, he would answer:\n– And if I say this to them, will it help us?…I wouldn’t get anything more out of them either way… But I’ll get a lot more from an actor with talent…\nDuring those rehearsals, he made Schwartz so depressed that it was no wonder that Schwartz really took it to heart, and a day before the performance he told us that he wasn’t able to perform because he didn’t feel well. So they gave his role to Simonoff, and Kessler didn’t say anything to him but just let him perform the role however he wanted…\nKessler only delighted when he had the chance to put on a better piece written by a good dramatist - it was like a yontif for him. But not so for the bad pieces; he used to say that having to recite the lines the “Professor”2 wrote was just like chewing oakum. When performing those kind of plays, he would make fun of everyone’s role - and indeed his own role too - and there was such confusion on stage that nobody knew what on earth he was doing…\nHe clashed with the actors in troupe many times over the fact that, often, he didn’t even know his own role, and many times it blew up into a whole debacle.\nI remember how once, in Brooklyn’s Lyric Theater, we put on Goldfaden’s historical operetta Bar Kochba, and they gave me the role of the Roman governor. Kessler, apparently, had no real desire to play Bar Kochba. As usual, he relied on the fact that he had played the role of Bar Kochba many times before, so he didn’t bother to study it or rehearse at all.\nThis was during the scene where the governor, drunk, sits on the throne and his men come to him to tell him that Bar Kochba wants to see him. I knew my role well because I studied it well, and like a true Roman governor, I said my line great fanfare:\n– Bring him here, but first take his sword!\nAnd then Kessler, in the role of Bar Kochba strode forward - tall, strong, healthy, vigorous, looming. And when he looked at me, such a little governor on such a big throne, he apparently thought it was so amusing that he couldn’t help himself - when he turned to speak to me, he didn’t call me governor, but:\n– Governium!3\nAnd you could tell that he was barely able to keep from bursting out laughing… In this mischievous mood which suddenly came over him, he forgot the line he was supposed to say. He knew well that even two seconds of silence on the stage is like an eternity, so angrily began to grumble at the prompter to “give him a seed,” all the while looking at me and blurting out the only word he could think of:\n– Governium!\nAt this point the mood became more tense. I felt like the audience was starting to lose patience, and I heard how here and there they were starting to laugh at us. I took this very personally because, by the way Kessler behaved, it seemed that he, Bar Kochba, was making fun of the fact that such a grand Roman governor was just a small little man. I suddenly grew angry and, with a grand gesture from the throne, I issued an order to the servants:\n– Take him away, this Bar Kochba, and choke him!\nThese were, of course, my own words. They were not part of the play. But I delivered the line in such a way that went well with all the chaos that Kessler brought onto the stage. I had no other choice…\nAfter that happened, it was very hard to turn things around to be able to continue the play. When the act ended and I was back in my dressing room, irritated and enraged at what had happened, I heard a loud racket from a dressing room upstairs where Kessler’s room was. And soon I heard steps, and Kessler’s servant came to me and said:\n– Mr. Kessler wants you to go up to see him!\nBut I did not want to:\n– I will not go! - I fumed back at him. - If he wants to see me, then he should come down to me…\nAnd so he came down. But he didn’t come to my dressing room; he stopped on the steps and shouted at the top of his lungs:\n– Where is he, the Philadelphia “big shot”?\nAnd when he sent for me again, I called back that the “Philadelphia big shot” has a name and that name is Mr. Kasten…\nIn my anger, I stood my ground. When Kessler, still standing on the stairs, called me “Mr. Kasten,” I came out to see him. I was sure that this time we would have a big fight, and afterwards we would never speak to each other again…\nBut it went entirely differently. At first, Kessler was angry, and he scolded me for doing such a thing to him on the stage. And when it was my turn, I scolded him back for not knowing his own role, he started to actually listen to what I was saying. With a bowed head, he listened to every word, and then he was silent. Even when I criticized him for at times being cruel and never taking responsibility for it, he was silent. And when I was finished, he took me by the hand and said to me, in an imploring tone:\n– Kasey, let’s forget about it!\nJust as suddenly as he, the great artist David Kessler, became as angry as a wolf, he became as gentle as a little lamb - and right on the spot, too. When he realized that he was in the wrong, he apologized.\nIn general, David Kessler was not one of those stars who wrote down every wrong done to him in a little black book. He didn’t keep a record of how the actors in the troupe behaved. He was not a vindictive person. He was able to go easily from angry to calm, from furious to brotherly. This was his nature. And he hated actors who behaved like high and mighty artists when in reality they were pathetic souls with little talent…\nMany actors saw him as their enemy and spoke out against him as the worst man in the world. Kessler knew this and laughed about it, and when he spoke of such actors he often said:\n– You see4, he doesn’t understand, the idiot, that if he only had any talent and played a role well, people would see him as a man… You know, a real life man. And I would be the first to applaud him…\nThe whole season in the Lyric Theater went on like this; I had a lot of good times with Kessler, and a lot of not-so-good times. And at the end of the season5, there was talk that Kessler was going to choose some actors among the two troupes at the different theaters and travel around the provinces with them. Boaz Young immediately came up with a plan to stage a new comedy in the Lyric Theater called Mayn Vayb’s Man, oder Di Bigamistn. The play was originally written by Hyman Meisel, but Young had also lent a hand6, and he had in mind that the comedy should have a role that his wife, the actress Clara Young, who was not yet famous, could have a chance to shine in.\nWhen the group of actors was being put together to head out to the provinces, Boaz Young told Wilner:\n– Kessler can take whoever he wants, but I ask of you one thing - that he not take Kasten and Clara Young with him. I need them both for the comedy Mayn Vayb’s Man.\nWhile we were putting on the comedy Mayn Vayb’s Man in the Lyric Theater and Boaz Young was very pleased with his accomplishment, Kessler and part of the troupe were traveling around the cities near New York. From time to time, he came back and soon after left again to play his repertoire. When he heard that we were taking the comedy Mayn Vayb’s Man to Philadelphia for Pesach, he told us that he thought this was a good idea and he would come to Philadelphia to perform with us, and he would step into Young’s role…\nHe liked this role, and so he played it…\nHe was of course being honest when he said that he liked the role, because he was an honest man by nature. But, as it turned out, once he started getting into the role he changed his mind and grew disinterested in rehearsals. And when he took a disliking to something, there was no talking him out of it, and we realized that no good would come of this…\nAnd indeed this is what happened - In Philadelphia, Kessler played the role in the way he usually did when a role didn’t appeal to him. He simply couldn’t take it seriously. At every performance he made a mockery of it and no one could perform their role properly alongside him. And it was no use to beg him to stop. It didn’t help for Madame Clara Young to cry, either. Kessler just couldn’t take the play or his own role seriously.\nAnd in the end, the audiences felt we were just making a mockery of the whole thing, and they stopped coming to the theater altogether…",

    "text": "Playing on the same stage with Kessler gave me a great desire to be in better plays which portrayed real life people, and more and more, I began to look at roles differently from how I used to - not only as a chance to do a little song and dance, but also as a chance to create a real life person on the stage.\nOn this in particular, let me say, that Kessler had the same influence on me as did Mogulesko. Both of them awakened in me the notion that, above all, I should first consider what type of person I wanted to portray in a given role. For me, this became the central goal. And if I didn’t succeed all the time, it was of course not their fault, but mine - or maybe it wasn’t my fault either, because our Yiddish stage often required comedians to do some things that don’t fully match the character they’re playing.\nWhenever Kessler played a role that he loved where he could show off his artistry in all its glory, I never missed the chance to see him in it. The whole time we knew each other, our personal relationship was a good one. After the fight we had at the Lyric Theater, we became very close friends. He really listened to me when I told him, on certain occasions, that he he needed to control his temper and not give so much grief to the other actors whose acting he didn’t like.\nAnd just as much as he was sometimes rude to his colleagues, he was also polite and courteous. It seemed to me that he enjoyed being polite more than being rude. But he hated talentlessness. He couldn’t tolerate actors who had no mastery of the craft, and it often made him so angry that he was entirely unable to control himself.\nI remember one time when we were rehearsing a play, and I was given a role that Mogulesko had played. I had previously seen Mogulesko in this role, so I tried to imitate him in my acting. I didn’t try to add anything new to the role because, generally, when Mogulesko performed a role, he played it so well that there was nothing more to add. When Kessler asked me if I had ever played the role before, I said no. So, during rehearsals, he started to show me how the role should be played, and I saw straight away that he was following the same model as I was - Mogulesko…\nThere was no better way to play the role than to play it like Mogulesko did…\nBut the main point is that in showing me how to play he role, he was very polite about it. When he saw how quickly I caught on, he kvelled and complimented me:\n– You are alright, Kasey. You are alright^…1\nAs particular as he was while showing someone how to play a role, he had nothing more to add beyond how Mogulesko performed it because he knew and felt that nothing more was necessary. There’s just nothing more you can add to what Mogulesko had already perfected. And if you tried to do something differently, it wouldn’t be as good.\nHe had a great appreciation for Mogulesko’s talent, and he tread very carefully when talking to him. I remember how one time he said something to Mogulesko that Mogulesko did not like, and Mogulesko became very angry and raged back at him:\n– Hey you, Dovid’l! Who are you talking to like that? To me?!…\nAnd Kessler immediately apologized:\n– Zeligl - he said, putting both hands on Mogulesko’s shoulders - Zeligl, you know, I meant nothing of that kind. Let us forget it…\nKessler loved to speak in English, and he spoke the language very well, but God only knows when he learned it and who taught him. Apparently, the American atmosphere that ruled his home after he married his second wife, the manager Max Wilner’s mother, really helped him to Americanize.\nAnd here, I want to share a story that didn’t happen during the time I’m describing now, but rather a few years later when the peace between Kessler and his step-son Max Wilner was finally destroyed. It got so bad that Kessler left his own theater that was specially built for him on Second Avenue and he started to play with Thomashefsky in the National Theater2.\nHe was very depressed at that time, and things were not going well for him. Playing in the National Theater where Boris Thomashefsky was the sole manager did not suit him at all. He didn’t think much of Thomashefsky, and he didn’t like having to obey every little thing that Thomashefsky asked of him. He had gotten so used to being his own boss and being able to do everything he felt like. And on top of that, they began to bicker over whose name would be first in the all the announcements and advertisements - Kessler’s or Thomashefsky’s….\nThey bickered over it for a long time, until they decided that in the newspaper announcements, they would run four lines: two in one issue, and two others in the next issue. The first two lines would read “Boris Thomashefsky and David Kessler,” and the other two lines would read “David Kessler and Boris Thomashefsky”…\nYou simply can’t make up what happened next. They dealt with the situation by making the advertisements like this - One day Thomashefsky’s name would appear on the first line, and on the next day they’d flip it around and put David Kessler’s name on the first line….\nIn those days - I believe it must have been 19183 - he also played in Thomashefsky’s National Theater, and I remember how when we put on Kalmanowitz’s play Tsvey Chazonim4. Kessler played one chazn5 and Thomashefsky played the other. And not only was Thomashefsky the theater manager, he was also necessarily the director who, naturally, during rehearsals showed everyone how to perform their roles.\nThere was a scene in the play where one of the two chazonim6 comes home dejected and tells his two sons that he has lost his job. The gaboim7 at the shul didn’t want him anymore - they said that he was too old and could no longer sing. His voice had grown raspy and hoarse and wasn’t like it once was…\nOne of the chazn’s sons was a simple, uneducated man, but a very good-natured man who loved and was very devoted to his father. And the other son was educated but hardly good-natured - an egotistical man who always put himself first. I played the role of the good son, and if my memory serves, Maurice Schwartz played the bad son8.\nThe scene where two sons reacts to their father’s news that he has been laid off is very dramatic. The good son consoles his father, tells him not to worry and reassures him that just like before, he will see to his father’s needs. But the bad son handles it very differently; he becomes angry, and in his rage he loses his temper and hits his brother. Their father intervenes, and such tumult ensues that the two sons leave even more angry at each other, and the poor chazn becomes even more depressed than he was before…\nIn the rehearsals where Thomashefsky showed us how to perform the scene, Kessler sat there with a sullen look on his face. Smoking a cigar which he held the whole time in the corner of his mouth, he sat quietly, with implacable obstinacy, not saying even one word. But he watched Thomashefsky directing us very closely, and when he heard us fighting in the scene, he started winking at Schwartz9 to say that the scene wasn’t working this way. He made the same sort of grimace that I knew meant that if we played the scene as Thomashefsky had taught us, we’d ruin the whole scene, and our roles too, because…well, because it just wasn’t good!\nWhen Thomashefsky saw how Kessler was cringing, he was a little confused. He turned to Kessler and asked him how to show us how he thought the scene should be played.\n– Ah, yes. - Kessler nodded.\nAnd he showed us an entirely different way to perform the scene… He directed us to play the scene without all the noise and tumult. Instead, he showed us a quiet, but still intense and dramatic, scene. He brought in small details to show us that how we played the scene was more important than the words we said. In Kessler’s rendition, after the bad son hits the good son, he immediately realizes that he should not have done that because in doing so he not only insulted his brother, but his father too. He regrets what he did and makes such movements and puts on such an expression that you can see his remorse, but there was nothing he could do about it.\nThe scene worked really well this way - without all the yelling and screaming, it became very moving. Without using any words, Kessler taught Schwartz and I what to do and how to behave by playing both of our roles - both the good son and the bad son. He did everything in such a supremely artistic manner.\nEven Thomashefsky himself had to admit that the scene was better this way and that Kessler was right. And later when we performed the scene for an audience, they confirmed that the scene was very good - every time we played the scene, the audience applauded enthusiastically.\nThe audiences were also very impressed with how the chazn performed in this scene where he comes home dejected and depressed after losing his job because his voice wasn’t good enough anymore. In order to show his children at home that he should not have been fired, he began to sing, piously and passionately, a prayer from the yomim-neroy’im10 - Umipnei Khatoeinu11.\nAnd how beautifully he sang!\nAll in all, it was the strongest and most dramatic scene in the whole play. Even without all the yelling and the screaming. It was a quiet scene that brought tears to your eyes - a scene where the art of acting was more important than the art of words… David Kessler was able to do this not only because he was a great artist, but because he also had an extraordinary stage presence and mastery of the craft.",

    "text": "The closer I got to Kessler, the more I realized that while that he really loved to be flattered, he did not respect flatterers… He needed to have them around him. He enjoyed that they “ate fish”1 over him, as we used to say in the theater dialect. But he did not think highly of them, and on many occasions he showed contempt for them. Many times, he told them off so sharply that they’d never forget it…\nI never flattered him.\nI loved what a great artist he was, and we had a congenial friendship. Whenever I ran into him I was always happy to see him, and I could tell that from the way he behaved around me that he was also happy to see me. Once, on a beautiful summer day, I ran into him on 2nd Avenue, not far from his theater. Since he was in a good mood, he stopped me to chat about how the actors of the old times compared to the actors of today2. He offered some fitting remarks, sharing this and that in his own characteristic way…\n3According to Kessler, one had a yellow voice, and one had the voice of a folding bed… One spoke and lived like a man, but when he took the stage, he spoke unnaturally, and his voice came out like he had put an odd sort of pipe in his throat. The other behaved on stage as though he could swallow an umbrella…\nHe had something particular to say about everyone, both the old and young actors. He explained that the real virtue of the older actors was how they could do anything needed while performing on the stage.\n– Take me, for example. - he said. - I can do everything…\nJust then it occurred to me to kibitz4 a little with him, so I replied5:\n– No, Mr. Kessler, you6 can’t do everything. There are some things on the stage that you can’t do…\n– I can’t do everything? - he retorted. - Ok then, tell me exactly what I can’t do.\n– You can not dance, - I teased him in jest. - You can’t dance, but I can.\nYou had to hear it, how he argued back at me:\n– I can’t dance?!… I, you say, can’t dance?!\nI spared no effort and straight away, right there on the spot, I did a little dance just like they did on the American stage.\n– Nu, Mr. Kessler, can you do that too?\n– Of course I can do that! - he answered with a shriek, which was so characteristic of him. - I will show you… I can do it…\nAnd without thinking about it at all, he started to dance in the middle of the street. But you could tell it was hard for him. And just then a Jew stopped to watch, and when he saw how Kessler danced, he waved his hand and said:\n– Listen here, Mr. Kessler, and leave the dancing to Kasten. You’re better off sticking to playing Hershele Dubrovner7… No one knows this as well as you…\nKessler laughed heartily, and while laughing he said to me:\n– Kasey, you win…\nHe sometimes gave little nicknames to people, and he never called me anything other than - “Kasey”.\nWe remained good friends even after I no longer played with him in the same theater. The truth was, even though his caprices were often hard to put up with during performances or in rehearsals, I had no great desire to leave his theater. When he started to put together a new troupe for his theater, including Maurice Schwartz, Bernstein, and other famous actors, I was also included. But things turned out differently, and I ended up going back to Edelstein and Thomashefsky in People’s Theater. Edelstein wanted me to come back, and I always had a bit of weakness for him because he had always treated me very well, and I couldn’t forget how he had stood up for me on many occasions.\nThis was in 19119, and it’s also worth mentioning that this was the first time in his life Rudolph Schildkraut saw Kessler perform. In fact, he saw him perform in Got fun Nekome in the same role he himself had also played. Schildkraut was so enthusiastic about Kessler’s acting that whenever Kessler performed, Schildkraut came to the theater to see him play. And as for Kessler, he too was so enthusiastic about Schildkraut’s acting that he never missed seeing him perform either.\nBoth great artists thought very highly of each other. In the show Eykele Mazik, Schildkraut played the role of a youth, a thief, and he was really excellent in the role. I was given the role of the second thief, and when Schildkraut himself told me that he enjoyed how I played the role, I was really over the moon thrilled.\nLike many great artists, Rudolph Schildkraut also had his caprices. But he was good man who did not behave arrogantly around other Yiddish actors. He was always so approachable with us, so much so that it was easy to forget that he was a famous actor with worldwide renown.\nOther actors, and indeed others from the theater world, knew this and took advantage of him, and sometimes treated him a little too familiarly. But he knew how to deal with these types of people who didn’t know when to stick a pin in it10, and he would adopt a tone that said - “Don’t forget and remember who I am - I am Rudolph Schildkraut!”\nDuring the season that Schildkraut played in People’s Theater, he had some trouble because he often became hoarse and couldn’t perform. This always happened to him when he performed in any theater. His hoarseness not only tormented him, but also for those who had hired him. And when it became clear in People’s Theater that, because of his frequent hoarseness, you could never really know how well he was doing, Thomashefsky started to put on operettas. For me, this was not good because it was the same old story - my acting fate was in the hands of how well Thomashefsky was getting along with his wife Bessie: When things were good between them and the sholem bais between them was not hanging like a thread, I usually was given only a tiny little role - or no role at all.\nBut when he got really angry with her and rumors started circulating that it might end in divorce, I was given good roles - because I was given the roles that Bessie would have otherwise played…\nThis is what it was like in People’s Theater, and it was like this later too when we moved to the new National Theater.\nIn the end, as everyone knows, their marriage did end in divorce. Bessie Thomashefsky left her husband, and for a little while she went off to Europe. And when she came back, she was already starring in other theaters like a self-made star.\nI also left Thomashefsky’s troupe after the season11 ended. Over the summer, I went with my family to the mountains12. I had enough money saved that my wife and my three children could afford to do anything they wanted, and it seemed to me that God and man alike were jealous both of how well I had done and of my three wonderful children - two sons and a daughter13.\nI still didn’t know where I would work next season, but I didn’t worry about it at all. My name was now so well-known in the theater world that I didn’t have to worry. I was sure that there was a theater somewhere that would of course want to engage me, and I’d end up with a good salary.\nAnd indeed, I didn’t get just one offer, but two - one from Mike Thomashefsky who wanted me to come back to Philadelphia and play in his theater, and the other from the new Novelty Theater which the famous actress Sara Adler had decided to open in Brooklyn, not far from the Williamsburg Bridge14. Just like Bessie Thomashefsky, Sara Adler had also become a self-made star. When she rented the Novelty Theater for the 1912/1913 season, she was to play together with Rudolph Schildkraut, and they had already decided to open the season with Tolstoy’s famous drama Kroitzer Sonata15.\nTo have the chance to perform again with the great Rudolph Schildkraut - and on top of that with talented actress Sara Adler - was of course a great pleasure, and I accepted their offer right away. And so it turned out that I would not go back to Philadelphia - instead I played in the Novelty Theater…",

    "text": "We worked so hard in rehearsals that even in the Yiddish Art Theater no one ever worked harder. You see, Rudolph Schildkraut himself played the lead role, and because it was clear that the role was semi-autobiographical, Schildkraut played the part as though he weren’t merely playing a great Russian prince, but Tolstoy himself. He immersed himself in the role so completely that only such a God-blessed artist like Schildkraut could do. No one else could create such a full character.\nNow, I’d like to say a few words about the difference between Kessler and Schildkraut. Not about their different acting styles, but about the different characters. They both had their fair share of caprices, as great artists usually do. But whereas Kessler was never able to restrain himself and when he was in a rage there was simply no holding him back, Schildkraut was a master at restraining his caprices. You could see this from how he behaved during rehearsals and on the stage.\nDuring rehearsals, he never got angry or insulted anyone. Even when he had to work with another actor or actress of lesser talent, he never lost his temper, but he instead showed them how to perform the scene, over and over again. He never got sick of working with someone on a scene. But when he came across an actor who really did have talent, he was very happy and would usually say that, rest assured, they would “do good.”\nHe usually spoke in German when he directed us during rehearsals, so you might have thought that he doesn’t know a word of Yiddish. But while performing, he spoke the best Yiddish, and he had such a mastery of the language that it really was something to admire.\nIn general, he had a real knack for languages. He learned English in only a short time and played Shakespeare’s Shylock on the English stage, and he interpreted the character in such a way to make the Shylock, the Jew, the most sympathetic character on stage. He also performed pieces in Hebrew. We all marveled at the authentic, folksy Yiddish he spoke on stage. We also marveled at how well he read Peretz and what a master he was of all the Yiddish dialects.\nBut only on the stage - the second he came down from the stage, he went back to speaking in German.\nPlaying with Schildkraut was not only an honor, but a pleasure. You could always learn something from him while playing with him. He would often, while performing, invent character traits for his roles right there on the spot, making the characters he was portraying feel much more realistic. And still to this day, my heart and soul grow warm and light when I recall that, among the great Yiddish actors with whom I appeared on the Yiddish stage during all the years I’ve been playing Yiddish theater, one of them was Rudolph Schildkraut.\nAround the other actors in the troupe, he acted in such a way that you could forget he was a world-renowned artist. He behaved as though he was no more than just a regular member of the troupe. He behaved simply and ordinarily; he was a good, beloved colleague.\nBut one time, I just didn’t hear when Rudolph Schildkraut, while playing the role of the Russian nobleman, called out his servant Igor’s name for the second time, so I didn’t go out onto the stage in time. This sent Schildkraut into a wild rage, and he began screaming loudly as though he was possessed:\n– Igor! Igor! Igor!\nAnd when I finally came out onto the stage, frightened and shaken, Schildkraut slapped me across the cheek. And not just any slap, but a real good slap - a genuine slap…\nHe wasn’t supposed to slap me in the play. But he was so angry that I had missed my cue that he simply couldn’t control himself, so he slapped me anyways. But soon, he realized that this was not nice of him, and he felt very sorry for what he had done. But there was no taking it back. He suddenly fell to his knees in before me, and his eyes became full of tears:\n– Forgive me, Igor! Forgive me, my dear man!… I didn’t mean it…I swear to you, I didn’t mean it..!\nAnd he did this in such a way that it the scene really came out quite touching and emotional - so touching and emotional that the whole audience in the theater was inspired, and everyone began applauding. Indeed, it turned out to be one of the strongest scenes in the entire performance. And the audience thought that it was supposed to be played that way - that we performed it exactly as it was written in the play… It didn’t occur to anyone that how the scene went was not at all how it was supposed to go, but that in fact it was really a scene between me and the great artist Rudolph Schildkraut, who got down on his knees before me and begged me to forgive him for getting so flustered on stage that he slapped me - a real slap - for missing my cue.\nAfter we finished playing the act, Schildkraut came to me backstage. Speaking in German as he always did offstage, he again begged me to forgive him. He was deeply apologetic and assured me that he was eating himself alive over what he had done. He asked me several times if I was actually hurt. And suddenly a wide smile spread across his face. He looked me in the eyes and said that now it has to stay like this…\n– What has to stay like this? - I replied.\n– The scene where I slap you and fall to my knees…\nAnd he started to enthusiastically talk about how wonderful and powerful and natural the scene turned out, how much the audience loved it, and how it completely fit the character of the Russian nobleman that Tolstoy had written in his piece Kroitzer Sonata.\n– This is brilliant! - he kvelled. - This is wonderful!\nEnthusiastically, he told me how the Russian nobleman in Tolstoy’s Kroitzer Sonata really would do such a thing as hit his servant in a moment of anger, but soon after regret it and fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness.\n– This is really authentically Russian! Authentically Russian! - he was really delighted.\nAnd so it was - from that day on, we played that scene in Tolstoy’s Kroitzer Sonata just as we played it in that performance: I would come onto the stage frightened after he called out Igor’s name several times, and then he would angrily slap me. He would then immediately regret what he had done and fall to his knees to beg my forgiveness, and I would forgive him…\nChanging Schildkraut’s mind was absolutely impossible. He was so adamant about this that no one in the world could have convinced him otherwise. And every time we performed this scene together on stage, it was always so powerful and so artistic and made such an impression with the audience that it was no wonder that the theater shook with resounding applause2…",

    "text": "Respectable audiences1 really enjoyed Tolstoy’s drama Kroitzer Sonata and the fine acting. Critics wrote that if you wanted to see a truly good performance with good acting, you should go to the Novelty Theater in Williamsburg. But it didn’t matter what they wrote…\nFor the first few weeks, business wasn’t bad2. But then it started to get worse and worse. The Jewish audiences from New York didn’t feel like going all the way out to Williamsburg to see Tolstoy’s play, and it was a real pity. This really frustrated Rudolph Schildkraut because he was sure that if we were performing in a theater in New York, the show would have been a great success and would certainly run for the entire season.\nHaving no other choice, we took down Tolstoy’s play, and we instead put on some melodrama called Zalmon Troubadour3. It was an older play, a German one, which Schildkraut had brought with him from Berlin. We quickly adapted the play into Yiddish and put it on, but we had no luck with this play either.\nIn general, we weren’t very lucky in the Novelty Theater because our expenses were very high, and the local audiences who usually came to the theater did not make a very good living themselves. A troupe like the one we had really should have been playing in a bigger theater in New York, not in some small theater in the wasteland of Williamsburg.\nEven our performance of the melodrama Zalmon Troubadour was very well-done. Schildkraut played the role of a gambler who became so addicted to playing cards that it was like an illness without a cure. I played the guy who lends him money. Even in this melodrama it was a pleasure to watch him perform because he portrayed the role as no other actor could.\nEven in a foolish melodrama that was as far as you could get from high literature, Rudolph Schildkraut was still able to unearth the real life essence of the character and bring out its authenticity. Indeed, he felt that theater didn’t always have to be literature, and he openly said that he used to love performing in melodramas. He could smooth out the ridiculous parts of a melodrama so that you couldn’t even tell they were there. Because he felt less constrained in this type of play, he could ham it up a lot more - on this, you could rely.\nBut what good was it to stage such good acting when the Jewish audiences in New York wouldn’t come all the way out to Williamsburg to see Rudolph Schildkraut perform in the Novelty Theater?\nAs it turned out, you might as well take the whole Novelty Theater on your shoulders and carry it over to New York and place it down on Second Avenue.4\nIt was around that time that Bessie Thomashefsky returned from Europe, and it was no longer a secret to anyone that she had divorced Boris Thomashefsky. And muddled up with this was the new young prima donna Regina Zuckerberg with whom Boris Thomashefsky was deeply in love…\nAs it usually went in these sorts of situations, some in our little Yiddish theater world maintained that married couples must not split up. And others said that it was for the better, because what kind of life was this for a wife who knows that her husband has a lover on the side?\nRumors swirled all around, and the slanderers, men and women alike, were busy gossiping over the love between Thomashefsky and Regina Zuckerberg, just as though there were nothing more important in the whole world… And everyone was wanted to guess: Will their love last forever, or will it not last and end just like many other affairs have ended…?\nBut anyone could see that, this time, Thomashefsky was truly deeply in love. And they said that it was actually better for Bessie that things ended this way, because now she could be a “star” herself. She would show him that she could build her own career without him and make an even bigger name for herself than she had now.\nUpon returning from Europe, Bessie Thomashefsky felt ready to take over the whole world. Her will to show Thomashefsky that she was a better actress than ever before was so great, and she spoke about this with such confidence that you could really see that she would conquer the whole town herself and she certainly would not be disappear.\nAnd so it indeed was.\nShe had her first independent performance without Boris Thomashefsky in the Novelty Theater. They took her in so she could get out of her bad situation. And as soon as she began to play her repertoire - young men’s roles, of course - audiences began to come to the theater and business actually started going well.\nThere was nothing at all left for Schildkraut to do in the theater - or for Sara Adler either. They had not a stitch of work. Only during the middle of the week did they, from time to time, put on Tolstoy’s Kroitzer Sonata, just to refresh themselves a little bit with a “lively word”5. But on Friday through Sunday, Bessie Thomashefsky performed and was big hit with audiences. And the most interesting thing about it was that Rudolph Schildkraut himself also would come to see Bessie Thomashefsky play her men’s roles, and he was very amused by it and applauded her enthusiastically.\nHe was very taken with Bessie Thomashefsky’s talent. In his opinion, she was a magnificent actress with a lot of personality and charm. It only bothered him that the same audiences that kvelled at the foolish plays she put on had no interest in better plays. He believed that anything could be good theater - dramas, tragedies, comedies, operettas, and even farces too. It just depended on how you played it. And he would proudly recount how he began his career on the German stage in slapstick comedy roles where he would sing and dance.\nAnd that’s how the Novelty Theater in Williamsburg became a temple for two famous Yiddish actress who were both angry with their husbands. And at the same time, the stage was itself a battlefield where Tolstoy retreated and Rakov took over…\nIn the comedy Chantshe in Amerike, I was given a role of an elevator man, a role with singing and dancing7. At first it didn’t seem to me that there was much I could do with this role, because everything revolves around that one little aspect. But after thinking it over, I saw that I could make something out of the elevator man - I could create a whole new theatrical persona that audiences could relate to.\nWhile sculpting this character, as we used to say in our theater dialect, it goes without saying that I couldn’t add any heavy speeches to such a lighthearted comedy, where the whole world should revolve around Chantshe, and she should take up the whole stage. So, in my own way, I cobbled together a very interesting personage, full of quicksilver if not with life. I myself was more than amused with my portrayal of the elevator man, who doesn’t rest for a single second and is a good brother to everyone.\nI remember how one of the distinguished theater critics wrote in his review that Sam Kasten is the Yiddish George M. Cohan. And this was no coincidence - while preparing for the role, I indeed took a leaf out of none other than George M. Cohan’s book. I had always admired him, and I never missed a chance to see him in a Broadway play. You could always learn something from him.\nFor a few weeks, the comedy Chantshe in Amerike played in the Novelty Theater with great success, and we were sure that it would certainly run through the end of the season. But suddenly all of our success vanished into thin air. Audiences stopped coming to the theater and we couldn’t attract anyone - neither with Schildkraut playing in serious dramas, nor with Bessie Thomashefsky playing in lighter comedies.\nIt was bad. Very bad. The managers weren’t able to pay the actors in the troupe, and weeks passed without receiving any salary at all. We were so frustrated that there are simply no words to describe it. Here was a troupe, a good Yiddish troupe, with Rudolph Schildkraut in the lead roles - and audiences weren’t coming! But it’s possible that the audiences weren’t entirely to blame; it’s possible that the audiences did want to come to see a good Yiddish play where Schildkraut could show his full glory - it’s just that they didn’t want to come all the way out to Willamsburg over New York. After all, the world portrayed in Tolstoy’s play Kroitzer Sonata was foreign to the Jewish community at large. In general, this play was only for a niche crowd, for a select audience.\nBut because business was going so poorly, the theater managers started arguing amongst themselves; the sholem bais in the troupe was destroyed, and nobody thought anymore that we could try and improve our dark lot by bringing in some new play. And even before the season was over, they let the whole troupe go, and we were left neither here nor there. Schildkraut was terribly disappointed, and he said that he could never have imagined that the bridge that splits up Williamsburg from New York would play such an important role in the fate of a Yiddish Theater.\n– Strange! - he shook is head and slapped his knees with both hands. – Bizarre! Inconceivable!",

    "text": "Going around like a beggar without consistent work was, to me, always the hardest thing in the world. Even when I was sure that it wouldn’t last long and some theater would hire me again, I felt like an outcast and it was deeply unpleasant to have nothing at all to do. I was always like this since when I was young, and my story of 77 years1 has not yet fallen heavily on my narrow shoulders. In thinking back on my life, I am not Sam Kasten, the comedian who made a name for himself on the Yiddish stage, but Shmuel’ik Konstantinovsky, the possessor’s little son, who always loved to frolic and make mischief.\nAnd I confess, that even now, there are moments where I forget who I am, and I feel like I am still that little boy Shmuel’ik Konstantinovsky, and I’m only playing the role of a man named Sam Kasten who is already, boruch hashem, a Jew of 77 years…\nOf all the roles which I have played on the Yiddish stage, I was given yet another role still - to play none other than a director2….\nBut let’s circle back to the Novelty Theater, where I performed when Jacob P. Adler and Boris Thomashefsky were on bad terms with their wives. When the Novelty Theater closed before the season was over, I felt like a spare, and I became uneasy and restless - I was never able to sit still, neither at home nor in the cafe where the actors usually hung around in their free time3.\nYou must understand that not having any work when other actors did is, for an actor, one of the worst things possible. Nu, as usual, I went back to Philadelphia where my friend Anshel Schorr saw to it that I would, from time to time, play a performance and get my share of applause which I always longed for so much when I was out of work. And when I had nothing to do in Philadelphia, I came back to New York. And so I ran back and forth from one city to the other, never getting any rest. Which is to say - other actors were playing, but I was not!\nAnd believe me, the notion of a getting paid to perform interested me less than performing itself.\nMogulesko did not take any pleasure asking actors to perform in his benefit performance. He was always afraid that they would turn him down, and for him this would of course be a great offense, and he would be completely mortified. Indeed, this is why his wife Molly8 took on this task on his behalf and kept his involvement to an absolute minimum.\nGenerally speaking, the great artist Mogulesko was under his wife Molly’s control. He treated whatever she said as law. And he always listened to her, like a good little obedient boy. And he gave her every penny of his earnings to put away. Whenever he had to buy something for himself, he had to go to her and ask for money. She counted every cent and kept track of all the money he spent. She was very stingy, never spending even one extra cent, and he had to give her an exact account of every penny he spent.\nIt’s possible that she was so frugal because she was always afraid that, any any moment, her husband’s illness would render him unable able to perform and they would have nothing left to live on, and they would have to go to others for help. She was simply taking precautions so that, if they fell on even harder times, they would not starve to death. This was the situation in which the best Yiddish character-comedian, the God-blessed artist Mogulesko, found himself, after all those years playing on the Yiddish stage and bringing such joy to the hearts of thousands and thousands of Jews across the whole world.\nNu, I remember one time when I went to the theater cafe on 2nd Avenue9 I spotted Mogulesko sitting with his wife, and beside them sat the Yiddish journalist Itzhik Gonikman. Molly was visibly upset, and Itzhik Gonikman tried to calm her down, but it was no use.\nMogulesko himself didn’t say a word. He was just sitting there, preoccupied and silent. But as soon as he saw me, he started to speak:\n– You hear, Kasten - he said to me, - I too am a victim of Thomashefsky’s love affair…\nAt first I didn’t understand what he meant - I couldn’t fathom how he could also be a victim of Thomashefsky’s affair with the young prima donna Regina Zuckerberg. But soon it all became clear. Indeed, Mogulesko said again:\n– Imagine this - he said - I was sure that Thomashefsky would of course keep his word and he would play the role of \"Monkey Joe\" in my benefit performance just like he promised. But he screwed me - he ran off somewhere with Regina Zuckerberg and no one has any idea where they are… Oy, romance, romance…! - he wailed.\nHe then become very despondent, and he had no earthly clue what to do about the whole situation.\n– How can we put on the show without him? What will I do? How am I going to get someone else to play \"Monkey Joe\" on such short notice?\nMogulesko was always got like this when something happened that he did not expect - he became completely helpless and didn’t know how to get out of the situation.\nWhen I heard what was happening, I reassured him:\n– Don’t worry, Mogulesko, - I said to him. - Your benefit performance will still be able to go on without Thomashefsky. I will play the role of \"Monkey Joe\", and you can be sure that even though Thomashefsky won’t be in the show, you will still do well at the box office. The audiences don’t come to see Thomashefsky - they come to see you…\nI made the last remark mostly to reassure Molly because she, generally speaking, took a great deal of interest in the box office. She was really pleased that I was prepared to “rescue the situation.” Mogulesko was also very pleased, but he wanted to know what we’d do about the role of the “little merry negro.”\n– And who will play the little negro? - he asked.\n– What do you mean who? - I answered. - Also me! Who else if not me?\n– But how will you be able to play both roles? - he asked, shrugging his shoulders. - It will be difficult.\nI knew it was going to be very hard without him telling me, but my desire to help Mogulesko and take away his worries was so great that nothing could talk me out of it. And indeed, right there on the spot, I showed him how, in the prologue during the scene changes, I would be able to play the role of the “little merry negro” and immediately after do a quick change into the role of \"Monkey Joe\" - the role Thomashefsky was supposed to play.\nLike every one of Mogulesko’s benefit performances, this one too ended up being a great success. And when we all met up afterwards in the restaurant, Mogulesko thanked me profusely10, and he said that he wanted everyone to know that I had saved him and he would never forget it.\nI was truly delighted that I was able to do such a toive for Mogulesko. And when he told me that it would be his pleasure to return the toive somehow, I immediately thought of something he could do for me:\n– If so, - I said - I do have a request of you.\n– What request? - Mogulesko asked. - Don’t be shy at all, tell me. You can be sure that I will not let you down.\nMy request was this - after Pesach, the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia would be holding a benefit performance for me11. This had already all been set up with Anshel Schorr. I wondered if he might come there and put on Lateiner’s Di Greenhorns, oder Mishke un Moshke for it.\n– This would really be a huge toive for me. - I told him. - You would really save me too, because, as you know, I’ve had a really bad season this year.\nMogulesko didn’t even need to think about it. He immediately answered:\n– Nu, of course I will come and play! I wouldn’t be worth my weight in gold12 if I told you no…\nIn that moment, I realized that Molly was cringing and was really displeased that he promised right there on the spot to come to Philadelphia to play in my benefit performance. Mogulesko noticed his wife cringing as well and that she was very unhappy. And because of this, he mentioned that I had actually played in many of his benefit performances already. Speaking with a compassionate expression on his face, he looked at his wife as if to say that this time she should support him and not say no when he said yes. And since Molly said nothing at all, he took it upon himself and laid his hands on my shoulders and said:\n– I will come, I will come!…\nThere are no words to describe the silent scene that then took place between Mogulesko and Molly. You had to see it with your own eyes. It’s just not possible to describe. Molly’s gaze reflected both her anger at me, and at the same time also her pity for her husband. And when she realized there was nothing she could do about it, she simply said:\n– He is such a sick man, so very sick… He needs to be taken care of, taken care of very well…\nIn that moment, I began to understand her. And I pitied them both - both Mogulesko and his wife.\nAnd now we are coming to the last moments of my acquaintanceship with Mogulesko. But I’ll save this for the next article.",

    "text": "When it was announced around Philadelphia that Mogulesko will appear in Di Greenhorns, oder Mishke un Moshke in the Arch Street Theater, all the tickets were bought up in a mere three days time. The announcements were big and bold, and read:\nThe greatest three comedians of the Yiddish stage - Sigmond Mogulesko, Sam Kasten, and Jacob Frank - in one performance.\nThey didn’t need to say anything more. The rush for tickets was so great, that if there were more room in the theater, three times as many could have been sold. Nu, it goes without saying that I felt like I was in seventh heaven, and I was thankful to Mogulesko with all my heart for not turning me down. In the letter I wrote him at the time, I told him how the Philadelphia audiences were eagerly expecting him, and he could be sure that he would receive such an ovation in the theater that he’d never forget for the rest of his life. Everyone was talking about the performance, and everyone was looking forward to seeing Mogulesko.\nBut exactly one day before the performance, I received a telegram from New York that Mogulesko had again fallen seriously ill and was unable to speak, and therefore he would not be able to come to the performance.\nWhen I read over the telegram, my eyes went dark. At first I suspected that Molly had made this up so that he wouldn’t have to come perform. But soon I dismissed this suspicion because I knew that Mogulesko really was ill, and he often lost his speech and wasn’t able to utter even one word.\nThere was no time to lose. The thought that when audiences found out that Mogulesko would not be coming they’d tear me to shreds had me unable to stay calm. And since I knew that back in New York, Mogulesko was under the care of Dr. Held, the brother of Adolph Held who was at that time, as I recall, the business manager of the Forverts. I straight away sent a telegram to Dr. Held asking that even if Mogulesko was unable to perform, would he allow him to come to Philadelphia just to present himself to the audiences, since this would surely save me. If not, chalilah, I would be doomed and I would be simply ashamed to show my face in public again.\nI was really rattled over this, pacing around unsettled and disconcerted. And to this day, I can’t forget how I rejoiced when I saw Mogulesko the next day. He didn’t come to Philadelphia by himself, but together with Molly and Dr. Held. The good doctor, who had always held the talents of the great actors of the Yiddish theater in high regard, did not want to let Mogulesko travel to Philadelphia alone, so he therefore came with him.\nIn my great joy, I took them to a hotel, but from the way Mogulesko looked and from the few words that he managed to utter, it was clear that he certainly wasn’t able to perform. It broke your heart to see him that way. I reassured him as much as I could - I thanked him for coming, and I told him that he doesn’t need to perform. It’s enough for him to just present himself on the stage so the audiences can see that he was there, but he was not in good health, and it was difficult for him to talk, so he would not perform.\nBut he was stubborn:\n– What do you mean that I will not perform?! I will too perform!\nHe turned and beseeched Dr. Held:\n– Doctor, let me perform! I gave him my word…\nDr. Held had no great desire to grant him permission to perform that evening. This was plain to see. Molly also really did not want him to perform that evening either, and this too was plain to see. But Mogulesko begged and begged until the doctor gave in:\n– Well… What can we do, what?… You can perform, but remember: don’t exert yourself too much…\nAnd you just had to see how Mogulesko rejoiced when he heard this. He rejoiced like a child.\nIt was difficult for him to perform. In the first few scenes, he was so quiet that you could barely hear what he was saying. But out of respect for him, the audience didn’t think of such a thing as to demand that Mogulesko speak up1. They understood that his illness was what made his voice was so soft.\nBut after he had played the first few scenes, a miracle suddenly happened. He perked up, and he began to speak so that everyone in the theater could hear what he said. The audience was so overjoyed that the whole theater resounded with applause. They heard Mogulesko’s voice, his beloved voice, which always charmed the audiences so, and they rejoiced.\nThe actors on the stage were also thrilled.\nMogulesko speaks!\nYou can hear his voice now! You can hear it!\nHe proceeded to play the whole rest of his role such that, every gesture and every movement and every sparkle of his eye evoked enthusiasm from the audience. When the curtain fell, the theater was simply full of screams which for years and years had been heard across Yiddish theaters in Russia, Romania, and many other countries:\n– Bravo, Mogulesko! Bravo, Mogulesko!\nBut after the performance he was terribly exhausted. Sweating profusely, he sat still and didn’t say a word. Molly sat next to him, and just like him, she also didn’t say a word. She only looked at him, and in her eyes you could see an ocean of pity.\nI walked over to him, and I’m not ashamed to say now that my eyes were filled with tears.\n– Nu?! - He said to me, with a smile. - Nu?!\nI didn’t know what he meant by this. But maybe he meant:\n– Nu, you see, when Mogulesko promises something, he keeps his word and you can rely on him…\nBut I wasn’t able to think much about what he meant by “Nu,” and taking out a hundred dollar bill from my pocket, I said to him:\n– Listen, my dear friend! I don’t have much to give to thank you for what you have done for me. I will never in my whole life forget this. But you have to take this hundred. I beg you, take it. It is from the bottom of my heart.\nMolly was thrilled and immediately grabbed the hundred to put it away. But when Mogulesko saw this, he frowned. You could tell that he was uncomfortable with the whole situation, and with a pleading voice he said to Molly:\n– Molly, give him back the hundred! You heard what I said, Molly? Give him back the hundred!…\nShe had no desire to obey him, and looking right at me and then at him, she started talking about what a sick man he was, such a sick man, and he needs to be looked after. With this, she obviously wanted to calm him down and remind him that now, as always, he must also follow her lead and not interfere in matters that he doesn’t understand. But this time he was insistent and he held firm:\n– Molly, give him back the hundred! You heard what I said, Molly? Give him back the hundred!… I will be ashamed to look him in the eye if you take that hundred from him … He didn’t force me to play at all, so I won’t take anything from him…\nAnd when he saw that she was still not willing to give the money back, he became angry:\n– Molly, give him back the hundred dollars already!\nThis was the first and only time I ever saw Mogulesko get angry with his wife Molly.\nNo matter how much I begged him to take the money, I couldn’t prevail upon him. And when I said to him, how about the next morning I come pick him up from his hotel in an automobile and “take him out” a little to show him around the city along with Molly and Dr. Held and treat them to a nice meal in a fancy restaurant, he answered me with a smile and said that this he simply could not refuse, and I should come to his hotel the next morning no earlier than 11 o’clock.\nBut when I arrived at his hotel the next morning at the agreed upon time, I was told that Mr. Mogulesko had already left two hours earlier…\nHe had known when he would leave, and therefore he had intentionally told me to come later. When I later saw him back in New York, I complained to him that he didn’t wait for me. With a smile, he asked me,\n– Come on now, is spending your money on me really how you want to go through life?\nHe didn’t want me to spend any money on him. It was his pleasure to do such a huge toive for me, and this made us completely even2. Everything was clean, without even the slightest stain. His artistic soul could not bear a stain between friends.",

    "text": "Of all the Yiddish actresses who found themselves going through a big or small family tragedy or who had to deal with infidelity, Bessie Thomashefsky stood out from the very beginning. Not only her friends but also her enemies had to admit that, just like an independent man, she too was an independent woman, and her career on the stage didn’t depend on any man.\nWhen she stood on her own two legs after parting ways with Boris Thomashefsky, her comedy Chantshe in Amerike made such a splash that she became a brand of her own. Whenever business was going poorly in one theater or another and they needed some major attraction to bring cash into the box office, they brought in Bessie Thomashefsky to put on Chantshe in Amerike with her troupe, and they brought in a lot of money.\nEven the National Theater, where Boris Thomashefsky played with his troupe, brought in Bessie Thomashefsky to perform Chantshe in Amerike at the end of the 1913 season1. For her, this was of course a great triumph because it meant that business in the National Theater without her wasn’t as good as it used to be. And it didn’t matter if that was really true or not. The main point was that’s how it was interpreted.\nLouie Goldberg, the manager of the National Theater at that time, engaged Bessie Thomashefsky to play Chantshe in Amerike for no more than a week. Thomashefsky himself wasn’t involved. He wasn’t in town at all at that time, because he had run off somewhere with Regina Zuckerberg. In the theater circles, people said that the love between them was so great that a very interesting novel could be written about it.\nMany young Yiddish actresses were jealous of the prima donna Regina Zuckerberg because Thomashefsky had a generous hand - he conducted himself like a magnate, and money was no object for him. In awe, people told of the expensive gifts he bought for her, how he doted on her, and how he would do anything in the world for her. And along with their jealousy, they also slandered her. When someone caught wind of some gossip or slander, they brought it straight to Bessie Thomashefsky as if they wanted to show her what a good friend they were.\nThe sworn flatterers no longer flattered her as the wife of a star, but indeed as a star in her own right because Bessie had emerged as a self-made independent star herself.\nBessie Thomashefsky was paid very well during the week she was engaged to play in Thomashefsky’s National Theater - she made a lot of money in that one week alone. The income at the box office itself was huge, and this made the talented actress so pleased that she forgot about her grievances and the wrongs done to her, and she was really in seventh heaven. Triumphantly, she told to her close friends - “You see, they’re not coming to see the prima donna Regina Zuckerberg in Thomashefsky’s theater - they’re coming to see Bessie Thomashefsky.”\nSo, we put on the comedy Chantshe in Amerike. When Louie Goldberg saw me in the role of the elevator man, he wrote a letter to Thomashefsky saying that, in his opinion, they shouldn’t let me go at the end of the run but they should hire me to play in the National Theater for the next season. He told me this himself, and we signed a contract for me to play in Thomashefsky’s National Theater during the 1913/1914 season.\nBoris Thomashefsky started the next season with a bang. In addition to the prima donna Regina Zuckerberg, he hired two more prima donnas, and he hastily wrote a new operetta called Dos Farblondzete Shefele, and he hired the two composers Perlmutter and Wohl to write the music.\nThey went all out for this show, including something entirely brand new - they build a bridge, a long bridge, that stretched all the way from the stage to the theater exit. And on this bridge was a choir with young women, with me between them leading all the “tsoyn kodoshim”2 over the long, narrow bridge. Such a thing was “not done,” as we said in our theater dialect.\nIt was thought that all the bells and whistles like this in Dos Farblondzete Shefele would make the show a big hit with audiences, and the show would of course play for the entire season and we’d make “golden business” with it. But audiences weren’t impressed at all. Dos Farblondzete Shefele, nebech, was a failure. Afterwards, we tried to put on other new operettas, all written hastily by Thomashefsky, and we put them on just as hastily as he wrote them. Each time, people thought that this one would surely be the one to have great success, but they were all failures, and we really didn’t know what to do next.\nIt seemed that Thomashefsky had suddenly lost all of his luck. In the theater kibitzarnie3, people cracked jokes at his expense, and made wisecracks that there was only one person who could save him now - Bessie Thomashefsky.\nAnd Bessie was filled with joy when she learned about these jokes.\nAs it usually went in the Yiddish theater when things weren’t going well, we threw ourselves from one extreme to another - no longer playing operettas with all their “dances or marches,” as was the style in those times, we bought Sholem Asch’s serious literary drama Undzer Gloybn. With the full certainty that this one would of course bring us great success and would attract a large audience, roles were quickly handed out, rehearsals were held, and before we knew it, we put on Asch’s piece. I remember that at first, I was not given a role in this play, but when I complained and demanded that I too be given a role to play in Asch’s piece, Thomashefsky gave me some small role of one of the in-laws, and the critics greatly praised my performance.\nBecause my role was so well regarded, I really wanted the piece to be a huge success and play for a long time. But the piece as a whole was not a big hit with Jewish audiences. It was a huge failure and only ran for a short time.\nSholem Asch’s piece Undzer Gloybn was a powerful one, but it was constructed in such a way that, willy-nilly, the goyishe characters were very sympathetic, but the Jewish characters were not. As I recall, the play was about a Jewish girl who falls in love with a sheygets4 and converts to Christianity and marries him. Trouble arises when she requests that her Jewish mother and father come to see her; she wants to see them while she is in labor, a very difficult labor, and she is sure that if they don’t come, she’ll die of heartache. But the converted daughter’s parents will not go to her, even when the goyishe in-laws go to them and implore them to show mercy and compassion and save their own daughter - their own flesh and blood - from death. But they show no mercy and do not go to her, and she dies of heartache and resentment.\nThat is the “essence” of the drama, as it is etched in my memory. And it could be that because the goyim were sympathetic characters but the Jewish ones were not, Jewish audiences found it unpleasant, and the play was a failure.\nIt was in the 1914 season that Mogulesko passed away.\nHe died on the 4th of February 1914. His last residence in New York was a furnished room on a side street off of Second Avenue. This was the “home” of the great Yiddish artist who even to this day has no equal on the Yiddish stage. He could not afford a better home because over the course of his illness which drained him so thoroughly, he had to be judicious with his expenditures because, as I’ve already told you, annual benefit performances were his only source of income.\nHe was 56 years old when he died. And up until the last minute of his life, he had full cognitive function. He knew that he was dying. He often talked to me about it when I would visit him on his deathbed. And here, I want to mention what they said in the theater circles after his death about his relationship with me and his opinion of me: It was said that when he was once asked which comedian on the Yiddish stage should be his legacy and take over his roles, he answered that the only Yiddish comedian who he would leave his roles and legacy to was Sam Kasten, and no other.\nThat’s what they said.\nAnd as long as I live, I will not forget the pleasure that I had every time I saw him in his roles, and every time I played together with him on the stage.\nIt was an honor to know Mogulesko and be his friend. It was an honor for a Yiddish actor to live in the same generation as Mogulesko.\nEven now, we have never had an artist as great as Mogulesko on our Yiddish stage.\nMay his name ever remain among us! זאָל זיין נאָמען אויף אייביק בלײַבן צווישען אונז!",

    "text": "At Thomashefsky’s theater, you never knew what role you’d be cast in next week, or even tomorrow. Thomashefsky never stuck to one style of play. When the operettas that revolved around dances, marches, and songs didn’t go well, he would instead put on a serious drama. And if the serious drama wasn’t successful, he immediately reversed course and went back to putting on operettas.\nSo we got tossed back and forth from one kind of play to another, when we never knew what we’d end up doing next. And here I have to mention, that even though Thomashefsky was considered an operetta-oriented actor, he very much excelled in serious roles too. He only had to will it, and he would play very well. The truth was that he had a good sense of realism when playing dramas. He could play them naturally and bring the characters to life. But as though he were possessed by some kind of dybbuk, he was inclined to have a haughty and pompous tone, and he felt more at home in a foolish operetta than in a realistic drama.\nBut perhaps he just wanted to show that, in the theater, he was a “master of everything.”\nAbraham Shomer was a very good director. He had a solid understanding of the theater and a healthy sense of realism and how to perform with a natural tone. He could hold a firm command of the room so that everyone had to obey him during rehearsals, even when they thought that he was wrong. I experienced this myself, and I remember how I argued with him over one scene for a while, but I couldn’t persuade him one bit.\nThat’s how I interpreted the scene, so that’s how I performed it during rehearsals.\nBut Abraham Shomer didn’t want me to play it like that.\n– We don’t need all this! - he said. - Why all the tumult? Why all the commotion?\nHe insisted that I should play the scene calmly and casually, and I should behave as though the whole story with the wagon, the cooler, and the horses was nothing special but just a regular thing that there’s no need to get excited about.\nHe insisted on naturalness. When I pointed out to him that in this role, the excitement was natural, he replied that in fact a more relaxed tone would be more natural here. I thought my interpretation was right and his was wrong, but I couldn’t convince him. Thomashefsky also agreed with me, and he advised to play it in rehearsals the way Abraham Shomer wanted, but in the actual performance to play it the way I wanted.\n– Your way will be better! - he said. - And you will see that afterwards, he’ll admit that you were right.\nAnd so that’s what I did.\nDuring rehearsals, I played the scene as Abraham Shomer wanted. But when it came time to perform on stage, I played the scene as I interpreted it, and it really did come out better. It was much more fitting for the shadchan type of character. You could see this much more clearly in the actual performance than during rehearsals. And Abraham Shomer himself also had to admit that I was right.\nWe enjoyed the show very much. I was very pleased with it, and I was pleased with the role I played in Abraham Shomer’s fine comedy Der Griner Milyoner. And I remember how one time, I was told that the great Yiddish writer Sholem Aleichem was in the audience for a performance3, I was especially excited because I wanted to blow him away more than anyone else would. When I met him after the performance and he complimented me on my acting, it was a very, very important moment for me.\nThe time I met Sholem Aleichem after that performance is etched forever in my memory. I remember how taken aback I was when he, in his own unique way, told me that I had stolen from him when creating the shadchan character as a “Sholem Aleichem-type” of Jew. But soon I got control of myself and responded with a smile: “Who then should I steal from, if not Sholem Aleichem?” He enjoyed my answer and laughed.\nThe huge success of Abraham Shomer‘s Der Griner Milyoner was quite the surprise for all the actors in the troupe. And when they recalled how at the beginning they were sure that the play would flop, they said it just goes to show how in the theater you never know what will succeed and what will fail, and whatever happens is no more than coincidence. But the truth was it was no coincidence. The play really was a good one with a healthy sense of humor. It was popular, the plot was natural and flowed well from one scene to the next, and the acting was good. Thomashefsky was brilliant in the role of the “cooler-man.” Leon Blank played the role of the shoemaker better than you could imagine. Gershon Rubin also later excelled in the same role. And as for my performance as the shadchan, the critics’ reviews really pleased me a lot. In private conversations, prominent Jews - among them the likes Dr. Shmaryahu Levin - also complemented my acting.\nWe ended the season with Der Griner Milyoner, and then over the years it was put on again from time to time. Whenever it was put on, the theater was always packed. Many people came to see the play not once, but two or three times. And I am more than certain that if we had a “repertoire-theater” where we could put on, from time to time, the best plays from the old days, Abraham Shomer’s Der Griner Milyoner would still be a big hit.\nBut we have a problem in the Yiddish theater - after a play has finished its run, it is hidden away somewhere in a box and never taken out again. And this is a shame, a great shame. Such a fine comedy as Der Griner Milyoner deserves to be staged again from time to time. For the audiences who really love quality Yiddish theater, it would be refreshing, and I feel it is my duty to mention this here.",

    "text": "As with everything he did, Thomashefsky really went all out for this operetta, so much that it was excessive. Everything was over the top. In addition, the operetta had a very strange sort of composition, like a rivalry between the music and the libretto. It was hard to know what stood out more on the stage - the music or the acting. The operetta had several delightful numbers, each of which was a pleasure on its own, but they didn’t all “click” together.\nIn my role as the actor Sigolesko, I had to sing a song called \"Ich bin an aktor\". The songs ends with posing this question to the audience: “Tell me, what do you think of me as an actor?” Isidore Lillian wrote the lyrics to this song, and Rumshinsky wrote the music. I confess, I had no great desire to sing this song. What would happen when I asked the audience what they thought of me as an actor? And what would I do if some wise guy in the theater shouted out at the top of his lungs, “Oh, and what kind of an actor is that?!”\nAnything could happen…\nI was really hesitant to perform this song. I tried to make Rumshinsky and Thomashefsky see that Dos Tsubrochene Fidele would be fine without this song. But they didn’t want to listen. They were both very insistent that I had to perform it.\nAnd this is how it went:\nBy the time it was my turn to sing this song in the first performance, it was already after midnight. Because I was sure that the audience was certainly impatient at the end of a long evening, my heart beat even faster. I was so scared, simply trembling, but I had no other choice but to sing it. And to my great surprise, my song was a huge hit with the audience, and I even had to sing it again.\nEven when, after the first performance, several numbers were cut from the show because they couldn’t keep the audiences in the theater so late every night, my number was not cut. In fact it became quite popular and people couldn’t stop singing,\nThe melody was so catchy that it begged to be sung.\nThe great hopes that people pinned on the operetta Dos Tsubrochene Fidele didn’t exactly pan out. No matter how great the box office earnings, it wasn’t enough to cover the expenses. It was impossible to cover such larger expenses. And so we had to stage a different operetta instead, a less involved one, a less opulent one; and that’s how we ended the season. Thomashefsky’s dreams that Dos Tsubrochene Fidele would “write a new page in the history of Yiddish theater in America” were dashed.\nRumshinsky had the same dream as Thomashefsky - he too was sure that Dos Tsubrochene Fidele would usher in a revolution in how operettas in the Yiddish theater were staged. There was even already talk of a special “Thomashefsky-Rumshinsky combination,” which would serve as a model for others. But it didn’t come to pass at all. Rumshinsky left Thomashefsky and went over to work with Yosl Edelstein when he became the manager of the Second Avenue Theater, which had been built for the great artist David Kessler.\nThere’s one more thing that I want to mention about the time when I played in Thomashefsky’s National Theater:\nFrom the start, Thomashefsky told me that from time to time in the middle of the week, we would put on some of the plays that Bessie Thomashefsky used to excel in, and I would step in to play her roles. Perhaps he wanted to make up for the wrongs done to me when Bessie played all the men’s roles which I should have played. Nu, I thought that now that he and Bessie Thomashefsky had split up, I’d be able to play her roles since he owned the rights to all of those plays. That’s what I thought. And when I appeared in Der Griner Bocher4, people said I was alright in the role.\nBut even if my acting was alright, something else was not alright - Bessie told me that she wanted to see me, and when I met with her, she was upset with me:\n– What is this, you take over and play my roles!? Is this fair? Come on, I dare you - let me hear you say it!\nShe was crying when she said this to me. I promised her that I would no longer play her roles, and I kept my word.",

    "text": "In those days, there was a new up-and-coming big star on the Yiddish stage: Ludwig Satz. Even in small roles, his acting was such a hit that everyone everywhere was talking about him, and it was said that he could end up being a second Mogulesko. Personally, I had no doubt that Satz possessed all the qualities to become a second Mogulesko. In my opinion, he was one of the greatest artists we had during the years he played on the Yiddish stage. Just like Mogulesko, he brought a world of charm with him on the stage, and he had an exceptional sense of rhythm. He had the talent of no less than ten actors combined, and that still wouldn’t be enough. But the trouble with him was that he didn’t know how to look after his talent, and he squandered his chances himself.\nIt also didn’t help that Satz became a “star” and started to get paid such huge salaries that he had to carry the entire theater on his shoulders wherever he played. This, I believe, led him astray, and because of this he could never become a Mogulesko.\nJust when people in the theater world began talking about Satz becoming a big star, Yosl Edelstein quickly scooped him up to play in his Second Avenue Theater, just as he always did when he sensed a new rising star. Around the same time, Edelstein also engaged the talented actor Samuel Goldenburg, and as it usually went, the two stars couldn’t share the spotlight - when one appeared in a performance, the other would not play. Such a thing would not have happened in a theater whose troupe had both, let’s say, Mogulesko and someone like Adler or Kessler.\nThey chased after plays that were written especially for them. Audiences were no longer interested in plays for their content, but rather for the “stars” appearing in them. The most important thing was that the “star” had a big role in the play, while others the troupe only served to support and create opportunities for him to stand out and shine…\nThat’s how it became, and as the momentum grow more and more, it was impossible to stop it. Whether they liked it or not, actors who were not “stars” had no real say in which theater they played, or in what kind of plays they appeared in. The actors in the troupe already knew that, no matter what kind of play they appeared in, they would never be more than a “middle player,” because everything had to be structured so that only the “star” stood out.\nLebedeff himself was certainly not to blame for what came of his great success in Liovke Molodietz and the direction it set the other Yiddish “stars” in. Even in the operettas and comedies that he performed after Liovke Molodietz, there were of course roles for other actors too. But nonetheless, after Liovke Molodietz, “starism” on the Yiddish stage in America got so out of control that no good could come out of it. The actors who weren’t “stars” but were still very good actors became very bitter, and rarely did they have the opportunity to create a rich character on the stage.\nTrue, there were exceptions, but as always, the exceptions proved the rule even more. And believe me, this is something worthwhile for those who truly love the Yiddish theater to think seriously about.",

    "text": "The closer I get to the end of my memoirs, I feel all the more as though I’m moving farther and farther away from the best years of my life – my best years on the Yiddish stage in America.\n60 years on the stage is no small thing, after all!\nWhen I began acting, I was a young man of 16. And now I am already, boruch hashem, a Jew of 77 years, and soon in April1 - if I make it to then in good health - I will turn 78.\nYes, 60 years on the Yiddish stage in America - that is no small thing.\nWith whom have I not played with on the stage! With the biggest and the smallest, with the best and the worst.\nI got along with everyone. And if there was someone along the way who I got on poorly with, well, that mostly wasn’t my fault.\nBut a short time before the season started, on one fine morning, that told us the news that Ludwig Satz had also been engaged to play in the Public Theater. I confess, when I heard this news I wasn’t too happy because having Satz on board meant that I would no longer be able to play the lead comic roles.\nTo take the audiences by storm right from the beginning, we opened the season with an operetta whose name I don’t remember anymore2. But I do remember that the operetta was staged so that the two “stars” Leon Blank and Ludwig Satz wouldn’t feel slighted and neither would eclipse the other.\nThe first two weeks were a huge success, and we brought in a lot of money at the box office. Goldberg himself said at the time that he didn’t remember a time in the Yiddish theater when they made this much money in just one week’s time. We thought that if the first week was so good, surely it would only get better. But then the second week came, and the operetta was such a failure that if we didn’t get it off the stage immediately we’d be doomed, and it would be hard to get out from under it.\nSo they quickly bought Libin’s play Kinder Fargesn Nit, and to be sure, just as quickly as we started rehearsals, the two lead roles were given to the two “stars” of the theater - Blank and Satz. The lead female role was given to Annie Meltzer, and she played it very well.\nTwo days before the first performance, Leon Blank suddenly became ill, and it was impossible for him to perform. He asked if they could push the performance back a week, but Louie Goldberg had no interest in doing that. Instead, right on the spot, he switched up the roles: he gave Blank’s role to Satz, and he gave Satz’s role to me.\nNu, it goes without saying that we had to do what the manager wanted. And even though we had to change things around in a great hurry, it didn’t go poorly: I quickly switched gears to play Satz’s role, and not only did the audiences love my performance, but the critics did too. As for Satz, he was so good in Blank’s role that no other actor could have done a better job.\nIn my opinion, this was one of the best characters that Satz ever created on the Yiddish stage. He played the role so well that after his performance, it was dangerous for other actors to play the same role because none of them - even the best - could live up to what Satz had created.\nAnd of course, as soon as Blank got wind of what a splash Satz had made in his role, he couldn’t rest any longer. On Saturday night, he called the theater telephone to say that he was feeling better and was back in good health, and the following week he would return to play his role and they should announce it in the papers. When the theater managers heard this, they naturally were not thrilled, but there was nothing they could do about it. When we performed the play the next week, it was nowhere near as good because Blank wasn’t good in the role that Satz had played, and Satz wasn’t as good in the role that I had played the previous week…\nThe first switch was good, but the second switch was bad, and Libin’s play suffered a lot as a consequence.\nWhen the actors in the troupe heard about this, they were all terribly offended. We all went to Louie Goldberg and said that Ludwig Satz might indeed be a “star,” but we’re not going to put up with this - in other words, we are not his assistants. We too are actors, and when we put on a new piece, we don’t do it just to prop up Satz, but so we ourselves can perform.\nThe manager realized that we were correct, and he took the piece Dem Rabin’s Zondele from Satz and gave it to Samuel Rosenstein to direct. But when Satz heard this, he became angry and said that if he didn’t direct it, he would not perform it in either.\nA series of messages were passed back and forth until Satz, with great difficulty, was persuaded to direct with piece together with Samuel Rosenstein and not cut parts of the piece and leave the other actors with nothing to do…\nThis was all in the year 19283, and I recounted this story because it is so typical of the “starism” in our little Yiddish theater world that had gotten even worse than before, after Aaron Lebedeff changed the game with his play Liovke Molodietz.\nIn those days, Molly Picon and Jacob Kalich had become big names. Molly truly reigned on the Yiddish staged. Every operetta she performed in was hugely successful. The Second Avenue Theater where she played was the center of the scene, and not only did the regular folks attend but also the intelligentsia who were well educated in Yiddish theater and literature.\nWhen the theater managers approached me to ask if I would come over to join the Second Avenue Theater troupe and play with Molly Picon, I accepted their offer with great pleasure. During negotiations, Jacob Kalich told me that he wanted me to perform without any makeup and instead to perform just as I am - with a smooth, clean-shaven face and a white head of hair.\nEveryone agreed on that.\nAs with all the others who were good to me over the years I’ve been on the Yiddish stage, I also thank Molly Picon and Jacob Kalich from the bottom of my heart. They were the last managers I worked under over my long career of sixty years. They were my last managers, and also my good friends. And since there is no longer a Molly Picon Theater, I go around like one of those “wandering stars,” and from time to time, when people remember me, I still perform somewhere, and always without makeup - with only a smooth face and a head of white hair…\nWriting these memoirs has brought me closer to the wider Jewish community which I have always loved. While writing, I remembered a lot of bad things that I had forgotten, and also a lot of good things that came to my mind quite often. But there’s no harm in telling both the bad and the good when recounting the entirety of a career on the stage. And believe me, if I could, I would do it all over again. It wouldn’t even bother me to stand on a street corner in Philadelphia and shout at the top of my lungs, “Parlor matches, two for five! Parlor matches, two for five!”, 6 just like I did some 60 years ago when I came to America as a young man with my mother Feige the Possessorka and “made a living” from selling matches in the street…\nIt was a long way. It was a hard way. But…\nBut oh, if only we go back and do it all again!\n.ענדע7",
